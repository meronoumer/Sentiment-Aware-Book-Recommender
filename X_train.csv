1093,"sorry, this guy's voice gave me the creeps. he sounds like a preacher. who can meditate without the ability to respond positively to the  leading   voice
"
485,"this novel could not hold my interest.  i am an anne perry fan, but could not get into this book.  i couldn't really bond with any of the characters and the plot was uninteresting.   i'm really disappointed, because i was looking forward to a new series by her.  joseph and matthew lost their parents to murder and joseph lost two close friends to murder, yet there didn't seem to be much emotion.  maybe ms. perry tried to tell too many stories within one story.  in reviewing the book, it's hard to pin point exactly why i didn't like this book. i would skip this series and read the pitt series.  
"
390,"the photo presented here is a bit too bright and the faces are not that orange in this paperback edition's cover. however you can get a feel for the checked floor and how after opening the pages of the doorbell rang you get an eye sore with the blue checkered tablecloth in the kitchen with the blue stove and red appliances. the mother and daughter are both redheads and there is a black cat that hangs around during the story that takes place in the kitchen. 

with just twenty pages my seven-year old breezed through the book in six minutes. the favorite character in the book according to my son is the cat and watching where he was throughout the story. the doorbell rang begins with a mother placing a plate of cookies on the kitchen table for her son sam and daughter victoria. "" i've made some cookies for tea, said ma"". the children each took six cookies comparing the look and smell of these cookies to grandma's.

by flipping through the pages of the doorbell rang it looks like the kitchen table got bigger, but upon further inspection the same number of chairs are there, but more kids around the table and fighting over the seats. the cat is making his way around the kids to receive pats on the head and attention. more kids arrived bringing a bicycle and a doll carriage and the table shows each kid with one cookie. it is hard to tell if the cookies are on white plates or that is just part of the checkered tablecloth. the serving plate is clearly empty at this point and all the kids turn to see the latest bell ringer. meanwhile over at the stove the steam is continuing but at a larger pace and it looks like fresh water now in the orange pail. 

the final arrival for this story is grandma, with a large cookie sheet type tray carrying freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. all the kids leave the table to greet her and the cat ends up alone on the kitchen table. not very sanitary as far as i am concerned and my son noticed no napkins or drinks at the table. the dirty floor was bothering him as well and he wondered why the kids never took their shoes off for that is something we all do upon entering our home. 

 the portrayal of the mother and how the stove was not being attended and having the cat on the table bothered me. the kids not stopping to wipe their feet or hanging up their own belongings and no one washing their hands before having a cookie and who knows how many times the kids each touched one of them. 

at least the kids were dressed nice and the bucket of water never spilled and the mother finally sat down. for a new reader this might be a fun read but for more than one read i highly doubt there would be interest. there is a lot of repetition with the arrival of new kids and then the sharing of the cookies while comparing them to each child's grandma's cookies. there are roughly two to four sentences on each page. the good news is that my son did not ask for any cookies after reading this
"
60,"the problem with this book is that it does not explain the mathematics well.  the author connects the unsolvable equation with group theory but does not provide any way for the reader to understand exactly what it is that is wrong with the equation.  why could the equation not be solved?  there is a reason for this fact, and the mathematical theory explains it well--but not this book.  perhaps a mathematician will write a book explaining why the 5th degree equation cannot be solved in general.  the reason is the subject of galois theory taught in high-level mathematics courses but explainable in a popular book; but apparently not in this one
"
435,"the author gave many thorough and enlightening illustrations on how communication breaks down &amp; what to look out for. after reading &amp; self-examination, one could identify the areas for  improvement &amp; learn  from the methods prescribed. the first part identifies the types of  relationships within the family. the second on developing god-honouring  relationships, dwelling mainly on the subject of communication. i was very  much enlightened by the types of circuit jammers within the family. part  three expounds on sustaining godly family relationships. it explains why  families fight &amp; how to turn discord to concord. i am very much  encouraged &amp; edified from the reading of this book
"
376,"this book provides a good and clear overview of the subject of mysql. this is a thick book that covers a lot of material. the last chapters even provided introductions to application development with c, perl and php. mysql: the complete reference really seemed like an actual complete reference. while it may not go to deep into every subject it does at least briefly cover each topic. most of the focus was on sql (structured query language) though.

there were only a few minor issues with this book aside from minor grammatical errors. for one thing, you would occasionally have to modify the sample tables before you could even start the exercise. also, it would have been nice having more sample tables and data so i could follow along in more of the examples. frequently, my result set wouldn't quite match the one in the book. additionally, some of the command wouldn't even execute or would return an error message. lastly, the chapters on development were pretty useless unless you are already familiar with one of the languages.

but, i believe many of the above problems where because of version differences and the fact that i was running mysql on windows. although windows instructions were given as well the book examples were still more oriented towards a unix installation. also, mysql would be several versions newer on my computer. i believe that made a difference on some of the results as well. and for windows administration its better just to use one of the suggested gui programs since many of the commands were difficult to run from the command prompt.

so, i wasn't quite able to follow along with all the examples for one reason or another. nevertheless, there were still plenty of quality examples i could follow along in. in addition, there was still a lot to learn from just reading through the material. overall, this book works well as a reference or for working the chapters in order. even though the book's user level isn't indicated i believe it provides a fine introduction for a beginner.
"
348,"when i was 21 and in my first year of graduate school, paul fussell's &quot;poetic meter and poetic form&quot; was one of the first text books assigned to me. when i bought the book and saw how slim it was, i snickered, &quot;grad school's gonna be a walk in the park!&quot; 
 
 yeah, right! 
 
 this densely packed tome is not for the uninitiated and definitely not absorbed in just one reading. on and off, over the last 20 years, i have come back to this book to refresh my memory and, usually, to astonish myself. the book's real strength, besides professor fussell's obvious command of his subject, and his ability to convey that command, is in the sprinkling of dozens of anecdotes by and about poets about other poets and poetry. even at this late date in my life, i can't pretend to understand the entire book but what i do understand i admire and respect. &quot;poetic meter and poetic form&quot; is not recommended to anyone studying poetry; it is urgently required
"
302,"this book serves the purpose of listing all available moves for the preset roster and shows all available storylines in the game.  that's about it.  no instruction on create a wrestler, or for that matter, create anything.  in fact, the previous two items i listed (moves and storylines) are pretty much the only content in this book.  i don't know; maybe i'm spoiled by prima and the good job they do writing for pc games.  they just could have included a lot more content, that's all.  you could have found any old faq in 30 seconds of search-engine poking
"
33,"the premise put forth in the title is supported by some keen insights into ""leadership by calling"" and comparisons to it with ""modern leadership theory.""  les csorba writes about the danger of pursuing results without compassion; a point with which i agree. unfortunately, some of the examples he chooses are questionable...  

after warning about the danger of weak character in powerful leaders, csorba chastises german chancellor schroeder for turning back on some promises to george w bush regarding the war on terrorism and then goes on to deride him for his four wives.  meanwhile he praises jack welch for going from neutron jack to a gentler jack (which jack says he would abandon if needed)while still making the ""tough"" decisions that got the ""results"" for the shareholders.  jack can change is mind and go back to compassionless results... ok.  also, there is no mention that jack was getting results with his personal secretary whilst the wife was at home...  

unfortunately the theme in csorba's examples becomes one of bashing the mistakes of democrats and forgiving the sins of the republicans.  he does sprinkle in some condemnation for a few wrong-minded republicans in a meek attempt at balance.  it's a shame that he turned this into a politcally tainted work.  it started off so well.  

it started off well even though it will turn off readers who are not people of faith as faith is central precept to this book.  it also started off well even though he chose to make george w bush the role model for how to be a trust-able leader.  unfortunately this conservative/political bent turned an even harder right from there and kept going.  it kept going to the point that i could no longer plan on sharing this book with some folks i know who really need it. they would simply say its a bush-ie/right-winger book and dismiss the valuable and otherwise soundly argued premise.  too bad.  csorba almost had a classic instead of a politically tainted leadership manual.

i say this even though i am republican, am one of the few folks who would admit they were voting for bush before the election, am a person of faith, and tend to find the dems an easy target.  but this book was supposed to be about so much more than republican politics.  too bad
"
1808,"good basic book, bringing back points i had been taught, and a few new to me.  price most reasonable. 
"
1843,"i saw the movie in a theater when it first came out. i was a teenager and, although i believed it to be primarily a girl's movie, i did enjoy it. i've seen it several times since then, and it still has not lost its charm. when i finally did read the book, i was disappointed that the movie didn't follow it more closely. to me, these are two different stories. the holly in the movie is likeable; the novella's holly is a harpie who cares for no one or nothing else. (when my wife saw the movie, she remarked that holly was, ""an idiot."") however, the book's storyline is more interesting...more haunting, and the book's ending is more intriguing. the movie ends as a love story. the book is much more. and, oh yes, whatever you may think of capote as an individual, the guy was a damn good writer
"
1815,"i am married to a native new yorker and we spent an entire weekend looking over this book and talking about many of the wonderful places it mentions, many of which we still visit today. as an extra bonus for avid cooks, there are recipes. for anyone who remembers luchows or any of the other venerable, now closed restaurants the book mentions, it will take you back to happy times and good memories. it's an excellent book and clearly schwartz has poured a great deal of research into what is his labor of love.
"
910,"oh my, all the terrible reviews for this book are true!!  ms. steel is excessively repetitive....i mean excessive.  ms. steel goes into too much background on the characters way too early in the book...and she continues to repeat this information over and over and over and over...you get the picture.  i too found myself saying, ""okay, we get it already...""  i also agree with one of the reviewers who mentioned the bonding experience the men had.  i don't know the men ms. steel knows and hangs out with, but she had these me talking about their feelings with each other, as well as how their dysfunctional pasts had affected them.  oh please, no man on earth talks that way.  especially to other men.  this book is completely aweful.  the plot is so slow and does not grab the readers attention.  i have read many of ms. steel's books and i believe this one is her worst.  i have now started reading sandra brown and she is sooo much better.  i recommend ""the alibi.""  so far that has been my favorite by her.  she has mystery, suspense, romance...  her words are so much more descriptive and interesting than ms. steels.  to sum it up, i was completely disappointed with the book ""toxic bachelors.""  i highly recommend sandra brown, she is a much better author
"
1346,"this book provides great insight on modern business development concepts and design techniques.  the framework provided will save hours of time spent building common libraries or frameworks.  the industry support via codeplex and the csla forum site speak volumes of the value it provides. 
"
797,"ms. phillips certainly knows how to tug at those heart strings!  i felt as though i were right there with mac and sammy jo, feeling the emotions they felt.  this is a great story that proves that true love can happen when  it's least expected and that true love always prevails.  i recommend this  book to any romance lover
"
1889,"i admittedly have not completed the full book, as it is thick.  however i do find that the narrative focuses on the reactive rather than the proactive tools needed for dfss.  for example almost all the examples given in section 2 talk about an existing system or process and there doesn't seem to be any design examples and how the stats are used to solve the design problems.  i therefore think the book is more about six sigma than dfss.

413,"i wasn't aware the only swords that existed and were noteworthy enough to grace the pages of an encyclopedia were european. seems to me much is left out by ignoring the eastern blades
"
1600,"i'm a fan of dave barry, i enjoy his column, i enjoyed some of his books in the past, and i bought this one with great anticipation. boy was i disappointed! the story is meaningless, the characters are not interesting, the events are mostly dumb and the dialog is uneven and unfunny.

do yourself a favor, do not read this book! i can't believe anyone recommends it
"
990,"it took cancer to wake me up.  i now do everything i can to inform my family and friends of the of the importance of a health lifestyle and eating habits.  this author also wrote ""what you don't know may be killing you""  these two books are great to accidently leave at a loved ones home.  they are filled with tons of improtant messages and very easy to relate to examples are given that help you understand what actually is happening to your body. my dad has gone from drinking no water to probably half of what he needs but this is a start, he will read more the next time i leave another book by accident...  this author is great! 
"
956,"there's no much to say about this book. everything is already said. and it is still the best book in the field. well done, nancy!!!

790,"i have always been a prolific reader and rarely do i come across a book for which i can find no value, no redeeming qualities. but i must extend a hearty congratulations to julia barrett for writing the most astounding piece of horse excrement i have ever had the misfourtune to purchace. teachiing my cat to walk repeatedly over my keyboard would produce a work of more sense. if you are like me and just have to read it - just because you're obsessed with austen - buy it used for 45 cents and then burn it
"
1416,"this is for sure a great book, if you have the ability to concentrate for more than five minutes, unlike the majority of the herd, in mean people, of today.  if your intrest lies in the substance of this book, read some other review, i'm only going to tell you that, the (1909) publication, stinks; the so called book, is more like a oversized magizine, and the print is about the size of a footnote in the bible
"
552,"trauma can occur for a wide variety of reasons. in my family across two generations there have been suicides, schitzophrenia, abandonment and childhood abuse. we are a, so called, 'normal' middle class family. no family is immune from traumatic episodes. 
i found peter levine's ideas insightful and helpful. his outline of the causes of medical trauma are particularly interesting. 
the chapters dealing with trauma in children help me consider avenues of assistance to help my grandchildren following the suicide of their mother.  i would like to read levine's subsequent book about childhood trauma
"
1545,"this book was amazing!  i'm giving it to my dad for helping me through college!  great gift for parents and children! 
"
539,"this is the best book. i was writing a book about my son who has si dysfunction. he is 23 years old now. i was in barnes and noble looking for another book when i found this. i was blown away. i never knew there was a book like this. i could have really used this book when marcus was little. it is so wonderful. i opened it and started reading about my son. my book is called what's wrong with my child? struggling with sensory integration dysfunction. it is only a mother's story of how my child coped with this thing. it is not meant to be a book like carol stock kranowitz's. her book is wonderful. anyone who has any questions about their child who has si dysfunction. this book is it. shelly r. wilso

133,"abby cooper has become my favorite amateur pi. the premise of this series, a young woman private detective who has strong psychic abilities which she uses to solve cases, is original and fun to read. abby is a psychic, but she also has the same trials and tribulations of a normal young woman, money, sibling and romance issues. in this latest book, abby, her sister cat, and abby's handyman dave, buy and plan to renovate a house, only the house turns out to be haunted! poor dave, abbey's partner and handyman, is attacked by his own chainsaw as he begins the renovation! determined to find out what's going on, abby begins investigating the history of the home and discovers a missing treasure with ties to wwii nazi germany. in order to solve the mystery, abby depends on her spirit guides to help her on the case. there is danger for abby and her friends from an unknown stalker and the romance between abby and dutch becomes more intense as they each must sacrifice some of their independence to become a real couple. ms. laurie has a great series going here, and i look forward to reading more abby mysteries.
"
859,"richard fortney's ""earth"" is a survey, in mostly layman's terms, of the geological history of the earth and how it relates to humankind.  fortney tells the story by means of a journey around the earth, selecting a series of locations where the earth's geology is apparent, and usually the meaning of that geology was debated by scholars to a greater understanding.  

fortney starts at mount vesuvius in italy, preceeds to the hawaiian islands, hence to the swiss alps and to other locations aroudn the world.  fortney relates the geology of each chosen location to plate tectonics as a means to explain how each terrain come to be the way it is.  this leads into extended and sometimes fascinating discussions of the former alignements of the continents in prior ages such as the ""supercontinent"" of gondwana.  for each location, fortney also relates the effects of the terrain on the history of the humans who have lived in that location.  along the way, fortney drives home the sheer vastness of the timescale of earth and its geological processes.  the dedicated reader will view his landscape with a new perspective.

fortney is a gifted writer with a good eye for the illustrative anecdote.  large portions of this book will be fascinating to the reader with at least some schooling in the sciences.  it turns out, for example, that the complicated geology of newfoundland results from its origin as pieces of three different tectonic plates (north america, ocean bottom, and northern europe).  the descriptions of northwest scotland as the remains of truly ancient mountains are put into appropriate scale in part by fortney's historical anecdotes and by his experiences of rockhounding in the often cold rainy weather of the scottish highlands.

the narrative runs a little long at over 400 pages, and fortney's explanations will sometimes outrun the scientific background of the average reader.  nevertheless, this book is highly recommended to the reader with at least a casual interest in geology and its links to human history
"
1190,"stephen hawking has crafted a masterpiece that requires only two qualities of the reader: patience and an open mind.  for those willing to take the (often substantial) time required to digest the material and accept (or even challenge) it, a awe inspiring world awaits.  this book is rightfully one of the best selling books of all time, and a must read for anyone who has any interest in the world around them
"
1079,"whether you're planning to read through crowley's book of thoth for the first time, or if you think you know every little thing crowley was getting at with it, this book is going to be equally useless to you. several of crowley's diagrams from the book of thoth are reprinted in this book much more clearly, but sadly that's the only good thing about this book. 

the book is filled with a lot of fluff. duquette tells many useless anecdotes of crowley's and harris' lives, and constantly excuses and defends crowley's character against those who would consider him a devil worshiper. duquette explains in the book that he initially thought that when he first found crowley's works, so perhaps its some sort of atonement. but the argument really has no place in a book like this where the reader has already come to terms with crowley's character.

through out the book of thoth crowley constantly alludes to and makes references to other works and various myths and systems. having a reference book that explained all of these things would be an invaluable aid. unfortunately duquette doesn't do this. his background information is base and scarce. he does spend some time explaining about thelema and kabbalah, but as one would expect from a chapter long explanation of subjects like this, duquette doesn't give nearly enough information to understand crowley's works, and what he does give is easy enough to find elsewhere.

as for offering anything knew or shedding some understanding on crowley's work, duquette outright fails. at times it seems as if duquette doesn't even understand crowley or the book of thoth and the associated tarot deck. i don't think the man even understands tarot in general (and duquette's own tarot deck is evidence of this too). at his best, duquette only manages to rephrase what crowley had to say in the book of thoth. typically though a lot of what crowley was getting at is complete lost in duquette's work, a lot of it no doubt because duquette never really understood crowley at anything but a very base level.

reading through the book of thoth, there are a few ways in which duquette could have made his book better. crowley's phonetic translation of the i ching doesn't follow the current standard, and sometimes the differences are confusing, especially if the reader is not already familiar with the i ching. a key showing crowley's translation and the standard translation would've been helpful. likewise crowley rarely wrote on astrology, despite astrology being alluded to many times through the book of thoth, and what he did write is hard to find. a chapter explaining crowley's views on astrology would've been great. if that wasn't possible, then a list of books on astrology that were similar to what crowley was working with would have been helpful. however duquette's solution is to just tell the reader to go find some books on astrology to read.

duquette's book isn't useful as a reference to crowley's work. duquette doesn't seem to understand crowley most of the time, and fails to adequatley explain crowley's ideas. besides some new-agey nonsense, like assigning celebrities to the court cards based on their birthdays, duquette doesn't offer any new ideas or insights into crowley's work. except for a few nice diagrams (which are common enough and easy to find), there isn't anything worthwhile contained in this book. at least not anything you won't get out of reading crowley's book of thoth
"
1329,"i think the most striking part of this book is that you feel comforted by the fact that the problems you're facing in your own relationships are commonplace. they're not dysfunctional. every family has its share of issues and you don't need to feel overly guilty for yours. the book's underlying theme is that families that honesty, consideration, character, belief and perhaps above everything else - resilience, can get you through the worst debacles and that at the end of the day it's probably (though not always) worth the effort.

stories include:
resentment about controlling parents who appear to display conditional loving and also about appreciating how much of their lives parents sacrifice to bring the kids up; the search for redemption after abandoning a kid or cheating on a wife, the courage required to break relationships that are dead and the perseverance required to bring one back from the dead (and the effect on kids), dealing with the families of your in-laws and family objection to marriage, how to deal with kids who are falling into bad habits when you feel powerless to influence their decisions because they no longer respect you or listen to you, dealing with the death of a child, how we feel obligated to spend time with our families rather than actually wanting to spend time with them and what we are losing, etc.

although it may seem that most people cannot relate to these situations... actually i felt an amazing amount of empathy for the families and came away with a renewed conviction that i can get the perfect family life (with all it's frustrations and headaches) and balance it with everything.

if you have any relationship, friendship that you have a certain amount of frustration, resignation about then i strongly recommend this book. it is one of those books that if it hits you at the right time - it could change your relationships and your life
"
72,"as mentioned, this book is amazingly compact, cramming three semesters of calculus and a bit of ordinary differential equations into just 800 pages. that conciseness also implies that much explanatory material and many illustrative examples are missing.

the authors mention in the preface that ""classifiers of calculus books would call this a traditional book. most theorems are proved or left as exercises to prove..."" nearly every result in this book has an accompanying proof. for those with a serious interest in mathematics, this is a useful resource. for most others, the presence of so many proofs can be overwhelming and probably is a turnoff.

included with the book is a one-page detachable reference card containing a massive amount of valuable information, including common rules for derivatives and integrals, geometric formulas, a few conversion factors, trigonometric identities and graphs (very useful!), and more. the book also has a three-page comprehensive table of integrals in the inside back cover and a listing of geometric formulas in the front, along with a commemorative timeline and portraits featuring the deceased european males who made calculus possible.

given all of this, i would highly recommend this book as an 800-page calculus reference text, or maybe as a text in an honors calculus sequence that expects to use the text throughout multiple semesters - then using it saves you money.

but for those who don't have a super-strong background or interest in math, those who are just taking calculus for a requirement or those who have never seen calculus before, or for those who are just plain math-phobic - using this book just doesn't make any sense. i wouldn't recommend it.

for those who are stuck with this book for a course, i'd suggest looking for another book to help you out. one possible book has already been mentioned in another review: silvanus thompson and martin gardner's ""calculus made easy"", a book that dates back originally to 1910 (!). i've read parts of it, and the book looks good to me.

i'm sure that there are many other helpful books; try checking your local/university library or looking on amazon for ideas. an extra calculus textbook that's more student-friendly might be a good idea.

as for the pages falling out, i haven't had a problem with it (i have the 8th edition), but i don't use the book all that much.

i haven't found any serious errors in the text, but i haven't read everything thoroughly, having only used the text for calc iii.

and, yeah, getting the student solutions manual would probably be a good idea
"
1251,"this book started well, but fell flat in the middle. what little conflict there was in the beginning was resolved halfway through. even the shooting incident couldn't manage to hold my interest because it was resolved so quickly.

well, i didn't bother to finish it--i have limited time for reading, and i don't like to waste it.

"
1246,"i loved this book.  it talked about every facet of the stock market, but didn't go overboard with jargon.  i knew absolutely nothing about stocks and after reading this book i am ready to learn more.  it was well written, interesting, and, unlike some investing books, the author was not trying to sell anything.  this is the perfect book for anyone who wants to invest but has no knowledge of the subject.  i really enjoyed this book
"
1759,"""ha ha ha hah ha hah!""  that's stirling laughing all the way to the bank.  or at least i hope that's what he is doing.  but sadly i suspect he more likely feels his wiccan/sca/dnd-infused vision of a post-apocalyptic society is a reasonable, nay, likely path we'll follow should selective physical laws break down.  quick!  stop me!  i feel the need to wave my sword, sing a gaelic song, and break out my cauldron!  the genre requires we make a leap of faith.  and as a fan of the genre, i do so willingly.  but having made the leap, it is annoying at best to be forced through this ""tolkein as faith"" drivel.  but as i will likely read the entire series (remember, i love the genre) i have to hope that stirling leans towards the ""thanks for the buck buddy"" and is himself laughing at us all.  but a picture is worth a thousand words and his mug on the inside cover tells me he believes this nonsense!

my recommendation?  read the book.  laugh a bit.  maybe laugh a lot. but do this with the library's copy, not one you paid for

249,"tony kern has managed to pull together the wisdom and experience of  &quot;the best&quot; pilots around. his use of case studies of real pilots  and real situations includes examples from the military, commercial, and  geneal aviation communities. in short, the book is useful for any pilot  whether they are working toward their private pilot license or are employed  as a senior airline captain. for many pilots, it will reinforce what they  already know and practice but for many, it will provide the opportunity to  become &quot;old&quot; pilots.  if you fly, read the book

789,"following up on the success of the chocolate chip cookie murder, this is the second volume in the hannah swenson murder mysteries.  here again, we find hannah coping with the brutal minnesota winter when the unthinkable happens.  hannah finds a body!  the local high school coach and secret wife beater is found dead face down in hannah's strawberry shortcake.  his wife certainly has a motive, but is she the real killer?  the police are inclined to think so, but hannah certainly does not.  with the aide of her sister, andrea, she sets out to find the real killer.  many suspenseful twists and turns follow as hannah and andrea proceed on their relentless mission to free an innocent woman.  will they succeed and find the real killer?  only in the last few chapters will you find out the answer to this riddle.

once again, author joanne fluke has surpassed herself with another excellent novel.  the cozy and inviting atmosphere found in the first novel continues here against the backdrop of the cruel minnesota cold.  many delicious recipes are included so you can share the experience right along with hannah and her friends.  her strained relationship with her mother continues as her friendship with norman grows and her closeness to her sister andrea deepens.  the novel keeps you in suspense right up until the very end providing an exhilarating mystery ride.  this is a novel not to be missed.  very highly recommended.

739,"college stoner cult following aside, hunter s. thompson's journalistic prowess was a vital national resource up until he left us last february.  thompson was one of those brave few who dared to cut through popular media perceptions and glittery rhetoric and travel right to the ugly center of his subject material, counjouring hilarious allegories where the average journalist would already have soiled himself in disillusionment.  

on the campaign trail should be required reading for all those who hold a less skeptical view of american politics than say, the average wwe heavyweight title match, for a truly sane person should be no more shocked to hear of a politician lying or cheating to increase his presidential hopes than when the undertaker strikes his opponent with a steel chair when the referee turns his back.  hunter has long since traveled through this looking glass -- although he can at times be found expressing nostalagia for the wide-eyed optimism of the 60s -- but the result is not nearly as depressing as it is hilarious.  the image of thompson infiltrating the nixon youth at the rnc and yelling obscenities and death threats at rival journalist john chancellor's press box while surrounded by hundreds of kids chanting ""four more years!"" was one of the funniest any book has offered me in a while.

how does the cliche go -- ""the more things change, the more they stay the same""?  after the thorough spanking of george mcgovern at the hands of richard nixon, hst credits the most staggering blow to mcgovern's presidential hopes to a media crisis involving his vice-presidential nominee, thomas eagleton.  just days after eagleton was named as mcgovern's running mate, two democratic campaign managers received phone calls revealing that eagleton had gone through intensive psychiatric treatment on three separate occasions.  as the story spread like wildfire throughout the press, mcgovern's presidential hopes were dealt a blow from which they would never recover.  since then, we've seen willie horton and the swift boat veterans come out to haunt their respective candidates, and one is inclined to wonder who the democratic ""mascot"" will be for the 2008 race.  perhaps a mentally disabled child whose tricycle was crushed by the car of hillary clinton?  a dominican prostitute who gave joe biden the clap?

but i digress.  i give on the campaign trail 4 out of 5 stars because the book, like presidential campaigns themselves, can at times seem uneventful.  thompson addresses this from time to time, wondering aloud what it was that made him want to cover politics in the first place before remembering that the rush one feels from being a part of a winning political team is nearly identical to that of a junkie getting that long-needed fix.  other parts of the book will only make sense to the more hardcore followers of politics.  for instance, hst's extensive interview with campaign manager rick stearns, where stearns explains the intricacies of acquiring state delegates, reads like hieroglyphics to me.

899,"noah webster's book is fascinating reading for today's students and teachers alike, as well as for the average citizen, as there is much to learn from it.  while it may be inappropriate to resurrect it as an  official school text, it certainly has a place in every school library.   one of the most notable features is the comprehensive phonetic system used,  with diacritical marks (accents) applied to all relevant vowels and  consonants; words are divided according to syllables and stress.  it also  spells the names of letters of the alphabet; something which tends to be  ignored in modern teaching.  the terminology of traditional grammar is  used, and there are copious word lists, with words grouped according to  common factors. i have no hesitation in recommending this book to all  students of the english language for the above reasons and for many other  interesting aspects (now-archaisms:thy/thou...; foreign words and phrases;  abbreviations explained; punctuation; etc).  this book should remain a  spelling classic
"
83,"i agree with the reviewer who said this work is boring. it seems roth is trying to glorify philip roth and not the characters. he goes on and on describing the overwhelming feelings zuckermann has for ""the swede"", without letting us know who the swede really is. roth should let the characters tell the story or try to use less erudition in his narration.
it gets to the point where the reader loses interest in finishing the book. i loved the plot against american because it was more character based than philosophizing about about the historical context of the times
"
412,"gerd ludemann writes, ""historical research shows with definite clarity that jesus was not raised from the dead...we must acknowledge...a worldwide historical hoax"", (190). a summary review of his treatment will be sufficient to demonstrate that his conclusion is preposterously more forceful than even his strongest individual argument can support.

three streams of thought permeate ""the resurrection of christ"": gospel writers each reworked tradition so as to embellish, invent, or explain away; peter and paul experienced hallucination and ""vision"" experiences proceeding from self-deception; belief in the supernatural is for the ignorant and unscientific. each of these bespeaks either erroneous assumptions, or avoidance of two hundred years of scholarly response against counter-christian polemic. 

in his chapter ""translation and analysis of the early christian texts on the resurrection"", ludemann applies a pattern of subtexts which he titles ""purpose and tradition reworked"" (re. gospel writers), and ""historical elements"". in the former he charges the gospel writers with adding to early tradition simply to reinforce their individual apologetic, or perhaps (he intimates) to cover up some element of embarrassment. for example, ludemann asserts that we may conclude that joseph of arimathea was a member of the jewish council (which condemned jesus), but that mark (earliest gospel) ""likely"" invented notions that the same was waiting for the kingdom of god and had become a disciple of jesus. but ludemann needs to discredit such notions, for all four gospel writers record joseph as the rich council member that buried jesus in his own tomb. ludemann's case will be much weaker if jesus is actually buried in a tomb that could be checked later to refute resurrection claims or appearances. ludemann gets carried away with himself when he, in tabloid fashion, suggests that perhaps the gospel writer is trying to ""disinfect a tradition...of a dishonorable burial"" of jesus. this is entirely ad hoc and enjoys absolutely no support from the texts he purports to analyze. ludemann goes so far as to accuse matthew, mark and luke of being anti-jewish! (refer to the ridiculous appendix 3).

is christianity a ""history of self deception""? ludemann invests in the rather high-risk prospect of hallucination; for the burden is on ludemann to successfully argue against several strains of evidence for the physical appearances of jesus available in the new testament. that any explanation can be posited does not equal all explanations are equally valid. ludemann simply fails to evince that we ought to prefer hallucination as that which is best attested to by the various strata of available evidence. 1 corinthians 15 is the new testament text historians consistently refer to as central to the discussion of jesus' multiple appearances. even critical scholars date the creedal portion of the text (vs. 3-5) to the early 30's ad. the discussion advances from death to burial to resurrection, three physical events. also, the post resurrection gospel narratives speak of jesus eating and offering his body for examination, as well as being hugged! ludemann though, convinced that he has dispensed with those gospel narratives after the fashion mentioned above, and prejudiced by his atheistic presuppositions, introduces hallucination. what accounts for these hallucinations? ""peter's vision is an example of unsuccessful mourning"" (165). paul's ""event had a character of light and, like the vision of john, happened in the spirit, i.e., in ecstasy"" (47). but paul does not report ""i was in the spirit"" as john does (see revelation 1). john is deliberately conveying a non-physical experience. paul is not. when paul does have opportunity to convey an actual ""in the spirit"" experience, he does so in terms appropriate to that experience (2 corinthians 12:2). so we have record of paul's ability to intentionally differentiate between the physical and the purely spiritual. ludemann employs his fanciful tendencies beyond credulity when he engages ""modern depth psychology"" to explain paul's conversion from zealous persecutor of christians to ""apostle-in-chief of a new program of salvation"" (170-171). so, we may more accurately adduce historical veracity from a study of paul's subconscious state, than from the widely accepted facts of jesus death, burial, empty tomb and appearances! 

ludemann's examination of history fails for he maintains a priori rejection of the supernatural. historians look for the best explanation of the evidence. yet ludemann writes, ""who decides at what point of historical study a `theological explanation' ought to begin"" (201). this is rife with misunderstanding. one need only confirm that an event occurred in history, regardless of theological implications.  also, simple and sophisticated philosophic arguments conclude that theism (thus supernaturalism) is an entirely logical proposition. yet ludemann quotes another author, ""[the disciples] believed in phantoms; ... imagined that they were surrounded by miracles; ... took no part whatsoever in the positive science of the time."" (175). this ignores the new testament textual evidence that initially jesus' disciples did not believe the resurrection had happened, and in other places they marveled at his many miraculous works. even their primitive sense of science informed their lack of expectation for such a miracle! 

ludemann is exactly right when he agrees with paul that if there is no resurrection, we should abandon christianity. sadly, he reaches the wrong conclusion. self deluded by a proliferation of ""one can imagine"", ""seems to indicate"", ""likely enough"", and ""one thus suspects"" reasoning, ludemann boasts ""accepting my perishability gives rise to a truer easter vision"". (210). may the reader decide otherwise
"
286,"in 1995 the poverty level for a family of four in the united states was $19,806. 37 million people in the us live at or below this level. ron sider correctly asserts that it is morally unacceptable for 37 million people to live in poverty in this country while the wealthiest people are gaining a larger percentage of all wealth. in just generosity, sider presents his vision for overcoming poverty in america. and it is a compelling vision.

sider's vision is distinctive because he acknowledges that poverty is caused by both systemic injustice in society's structures and by poor moral decisions by impoverished individuals. both must be addressed in order to stop cycles of poverty.  

drawing upon biblical study, sider presents the goal of an economy of justice: ""every person or family has access to productive resources (land, money, knowledge) so they have the opportunity to earn a generous sufficiency of material necessities and be dignified participating members of their community"" (81). sider deals with a vast array of programs and issues like welfare, minimum wage, tax credits, health care, and education reform, showing how each could be employed in ways that encourage work, empower the poor, and strengthen families.

sider ends with this troubling question: do enough christians really care? this book should be required reading for any that do.

1830,"carl hiaasen spins a tale of adventure and humor that should motivate young readers to protect wildlife and natural resources. hoot is set in the seaside town of coconut cove. the plot revolves around mother paula's pancake house, a fictitious restaurant chain in florida about to build its 100th store on a parcel of land inhabited by families of burrowing owls. the developers know about the endangered owls and removed legal evidence of the owls from public records. unwary citizens applaud mother paula's in coconut cove. 

the lone crusader for the owls is a boy nicknamed mullet fingers who lives in the backwoods dodging truant officers. he pulls up construction stakes and invents other nocturnal forays to stop development. mullet fingers enlists the help of his step sister, beatrice and new kid, roy. beatrice is a middle-school soccer queen who holds her own with the boys. roy is a level-headed kid who moves to coconut cove from montana, earning the dubious title of cowgirl. 

when you throw in a zany cop, a redneck construction boss, a sly businessman, a high school teacher willing to support kids acting for righteous causes and a bully whose attempts to squash roy you've got a pretty good read!

1768,"this book is undoubtedly very good value for a birding handbook (certainly by european standards). but the physical packaging is a total disaster. it has a ridiculously rigid spine and tiny page margins. it is difficult to read text near the spine, and virtually impossible to keep the book open on a particular page. the most unuseable book i've ever experienced

6,"the daughter of a prominent boston doctor is dead, apparently from a botched abortion (which was illegal in the late 60's).  dr. john berry's friend, art lee, is in jail for the crime, which he says he didn't commit.  so, dr. berry sets out to prove his friend's innocence, and runs into cover-ups and lots of secrets.  but there are many doubts, such as was the girl really pregnant, and did dr. lee actually perform the surgery, and why is dr. berry so interested in finding the culprit?

for michael crichton's first novel, it's not bad, but nowhere near as good as some later ones.  the plot is marginally interesting, but it was hard to keep characters straight and the dialog didn't sound very natural.  dr. berry (who just takes the whole work week off to investigate) talks more like a cheesy ""private eye"" than a doctor.  also annoying was the use of footnotes and endnotes to explain various medical terms and concepts - nice to know but annoying to look up
"
1315,"(3.75) the other reviews can reveal what this book is about. what i wanted to share is the extreme responses this book incited in my boyfriend and me. he alternately found himself loving the narrator, yuriko's sister, for her brutal honesty and hating her for her malice and psychological bullying of kazue. meanwhile, i found myself rooting the narrator on as she spoke the cruel truth about the pitiful hopelessness of kazue's meritocratic dreams, but a moment later i wondered if that made me a bully myself or as bitter and heartless as the narrator. perhaps it reminded me too much of what i had seen growing up to shock me.

then, there was the simultaneous hilarity and pain of kazue's cluelessness. was she a tragic figure, blind, or both? i admired kirino for inspiring me to feel so much for her characters, even for yuriko, who is certainly not the ditsy airhead her older sister wants us to believe she is (i also found it hard to believ she was as ghastly as she considered herself in her 30s: is it just because women past 25 in japan are regarded as christmas cake, as a friend from japan says?).

my attention was quite strained by zhang's tale of chinese hardship (it seemed the wrong book to educate the reader about how difficult it is for immigrants in japan), but i immediately forgave kirino when yuriko's older sister admitted herself zhang's account was tedious and could be skipped (i'd recommend others to skim it as well).

again, my patience was tested by kazue's journal: i just kept on thinking, aren't you ready to die yet? but i see this was intentional on kirino's part, to make the reader struggle between our (or my) wanting kazue to just give up on life and our feeling ashamed for our coldness and complicity in her bullying. it also made my boyfriend and me think concurrently of the people we loved in our own lives who were heading towards the same fate as kazue and yuriko, not through prostitution but through drugs.

what did disappoint me in the end was the last chapter, which seemed a cop-out. if only an editor had suggested it was unconvincing and encouraged her that an alternative, though more shocking, would be more in line with the narrator's character, but that is wishful thinking on my part. when i give this book to others, which i will, i will make sure to discuss with them, when they've finished, what they thought of the ending.

this book could have been edited down a hundred pages (back when it was written in japanese), but for what it did offer, i have no regrets for its consuming my attention entirely and will always look forward to further translations of kirino's books. this book may not be the masterpiece ""out"" was, but for anyone who has gone to an elite school on scholarship, striven to remain a petite zero, wanted to excel while recognizing how off-the-mark our values of judgment are, or wondered just how much her body could be worth, reading ""grotesque"" is just as powerful an experience as reading ""out"" was

89,"anyone with intelligence can see that ann coulter is not attempting to make any meaningful or objective analysis of politics.  she is using inflammatory marketing to stir up the emotions of the most die-hard, flag-waving conservatives.  until this attention-seeking labeling of other americans as 'good' or 'bad' stops, there will never be true understanding of the complexties of american politics or foreign policy by the general public.  i don't agree with bush's war and i didnt vote for him.  but he's not a 'bad person'; he did not invade iraq because he is 'evil' or 'stupid'.  i can appreciate both sides of an argument; i can avoid generic categorizations.  i would never watch any news, liberal or conservative, that had a clear political bias.  why can't ann coulter arrive at this same level of common sense?  well, she wouldnt sell as many books; she wouldnt be on tv.  it has to be ""liberals hate america"" or ""the conservative nazi agenda"".  we have the duty as thinking americans, in the most advanced free country in the world, in these modern times of massive amounts of free information, to stop paying attention to this garbage.  get the facts and stop relying on a figurehead to spoon feed you your opinions

1687,"native tongue 
by carl hiaasen 

this book is fast paced, has a lot of energy, and a zany weirdness.  no doubt, it is a page-turner.  and it is better than the other book of hiaasen's i have read, double whammy.  but all that does not a good read make...

a strength of hiaasen's books are his characters, well defined and numerous.  most are straightforward stereotypes, from the out-of-luck journalist-turned-publicist, the vapid sex-phone girlfriend, a steroid-doped strongman, the crude-and-sleazy millionaire bad-guy, a muscular-but-clear-minded black good-guy cop, to the dumb-but-intrinsically good-guy burglars, and loads of redneck florida ""crackers"".  hiaasen makes this cast interesting by having them jump through zany hoops, and by casting two characters that are quite original, an environmentally-militant 70+ aged woman, and an environmentally-crazed former-governor-gone-wildman.  and we meet psychotic whales and sex-starved dolphins.  etc. etc.

so what's wrong.  mainly, it's that the book stays at a level of tv-sitcom-gone-book.  it achieves zero depth in dealing with any subject.  one might think that the exception is the environment, but the story is so inane that it cannot achieve traction even here.  so perhaps native tongue is just pure entertainment?  if you like brainless action, gratuitous violence, gross humor, and zany ""fun"", native tongue might satisfy.  

i have one additional problem with hiassen, and it's similar to the problem i so often have with michael crichton.  these books stink of hypocrisy.  crichton makes a (seriously good) living off nifty science ideas while constantly bashing that same science.  hiassen's heroes work hard to rise out of the trash heap of modern society, but hiaasen's writing routinely wallows in that same trash heap for supposed laughs and zaniness. 

while i enjoyed a few sections of native tongue, i had no doubts at the end that i had wasted many hours that should have been better spent

""if you say your own name to yourself at such a moment, it will seem utterly alien. you will then understand the sacrament of baptism."" huh?

at first, i thought his writing may just be over my head, but after re-reading most of it, i realized it was just bad. it's like the whole book was written when he was high or something. some very good ideas, but most can be found in other, better written books.

881,"shadowbred by paul kemp is simply an excellent book.  the story is incredibly engrossing, the atmosphere set for each scene is really top-notch, and the journey paul takes his character's through is really incredible.

so i was more than disappointed after the first few chapters of eveolution. i hung in there as long as i could, but the male bashing that pervades the early part of the book overwhelmed whatever golden nuggets were in its way. i just couldn't tolerate reading any more.

perhaps her comments about or against men are warranted in some people's view, but i didn't see how they fit in with the intent of the book. the comments seemed gratuitous and unnecessary.

so hopefully her next book will be better.


"
122,"to cover all the problems with continuity, logic, theology, geography and plain common sense in _left behind_ would take a whole book.  one hardly knows where to start.

perhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to christian religion by this trashy novel.  as such, it isn't even a decent trashy novel; instead of steamy sex scenes, we get sanctimonious sermonizing.  worse than that, what the authors have done is to turn the powerful imagery of the bible into a cheap comic book, ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting a self-centered preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before it's too late.

the comic book aspect can not be overemphasized.  even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept the rapture scenario (an idea with virtually no scriptural support), little in the characters' actions, thought processes or dialog rings true.  one gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a junior high school student.  god ends up looking like the ultimate villain, demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side or else.

whatever happened to the inspiring christian writers of yesteryear?  who is the present-day equivalent of c. s. lewis, or catherine marshall, and why aren't they getting more attention?  these were writers who actually made you think.  lahaye and jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the last thing god wants us to be doing; they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or independent thought.  they show no interest in answering the sort of hard questions that surviving non-believers in such a world might ask.  one wonders if they have ever met a non-believer at all, or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter.

these days, it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of ann coulter or pat robertson, whose mission seems to be to turn christianity into a twisted, bigoted caricature of what it once was.  perhaps all the great religious thinkers really have been raptured.  if _left behind_ is an example of the sort of writing that we can expect from christian writers, then it is the church itself that is in danger of being left behind

599,"  while it's certainly true that there will always be a gulf between reality and words, communication between reader and writer is nonetheless very real and potentially profound, thanks in no small part to empathy and the imagination. deconstructionism, by denying presence and instead proposing unlimited differences between signs, dismisses any connection between readers and writers and turns language into a hermetic system separated from the outside world which is, of course, inhabited by people who read and people who write. this is exactly what makes deconstructionism so empty and hypocritical: it rejects traditional metaphysics while adopting a pseudo-mystical position which regards language as some unstable and solipsistic alien creature independent of everything and everyone

973,"alexander pope was not of the romantic period, and any book that thinks he was can be no guide to a gre subject test.  this alleged prep text splits hair in nanometers over interpretive questions, asks for identification of the most obscure passages, and frequently explains why b was the right answer, and why a, c, and d were wrong, but leaves that status of e wholly to the realm of mystery.  the practice test sent out with the gre registration is different in scope, clarity, and difficulty.  i actually tore out a chunk of this book with my teeth in frustration.  don't buy this book.  don't even steal it.  spend the money on deluging the publisher with demands to remove it from the shelves and issue written apologies to anyone who ever suffered themselves to use it
"
1400,"when i first read the title, my first thought is ""i know this, i've heard it before"".

that is how i felt. until i read the book. what an eye opener! 

i happen to be one who rarely gets sick, and recovers quickly when i do. i also tend to opt for a healthier life style. however, there is a family history of cancer. 

in reading this book, i realized that there is even more that i need to be doing to protect myself and my family. dr. rapp has done a considerable amount of research and shares her findings with the reader. research references are listed at the end of each chapter for those wanting to learn even more.

if you own a home you need to read this book. if you rent a home or apartment, you need to know the information in this book. if you golf or live near a golf course, this book is for you. if you have children or grandchildren in school, consider reading this book

1195,"i had to take a look at this book just like i did rachel shteir's previous book ""striptease"" to see if the online reviews were true. sadly, they were. like ""striptease"", this book was full of typo's and appeared poorly organized and written. one would think that ms. shteir would have learned from her previous book--which also had similarly poor reviews. i wonder why gypsy rose lee paired up with her. i can only guess at ms. shteir's fascination with this topic: my guess is that she wishes she could be a stripper herself (or maybe she is). i base this in part on a meeting with ms. shteir a year ago when i invited her to write about a professional conference i organized and presented at: she wore a very low-cut blouse as she interviewed people. i'm no prude but this was highly inappropriate and distracting people told me. on top of that, her article was chock full of misquotes, errors in fact, and adopted a perspective that nobody who attended the conference could relate to. oh well, i can only hope that ms. shteir's next project will be more accurate and also that she will make clear her real interest in her subject matter. gypsy rose, i guess we both made the same mistake: trusting someone like ms. shteit to help us tell a story who didn't have the heart or the skills to pull it off
"
287,"the man of her dreams the woman of his! is a book that is critically necessary today in light of our divorce culture.  sadly, it equally affects christians the sames as non-christians.  joel pulls no punches in assigning the blame to men's arrogance and poor exploitive biblical exegesis.  the back and forth style communicates the same cooperation and give and take necessary for successful marriages.  this book is must read for the engaged, newlyweds, and those struggling to stay together.  all cliches aside, this is a must read.

1923,"i liked this book for its analysis of political phenomena. however, i found it weak on issues facing companies today in china or that the new business economy has created:  there was little or no discussion of the institutional problems facing china in its transition.  the journalistic background of the author also peeked through and some sections were too breathless for me.  i disagree with the simplistic conclusion (among others) that water and pollution are the two major problems facing companies operating in china

"
1578,"anyone with intelligence can see that ann coulter is not attempting to make any meaningful or objective analysis of politics.  she is using inflammatory marketing to stir up the emotions of the most die-hard, flag-waving conservatives.  until this attention-seeking labeling of other americans as 'good' or 'bad' stops, there will never be true understanding of the complexties of american politics or foreign policy by the general public.  i don't agree with bush's war and i didnt vote for him.  but he's not a 'bad person'; he did not invade iraq because he is 'evil' or 'stupid'.  i can appreciate both sides of an argument; i can avoid generic categorizations.  i would never watch any news, liberal or conservative, that had a clear political bias.  why can't ann coulter arrive at this same level of common sense?  well, she wouldnt sell as many books; she wouldnt be on tv.  it has to be ""liberals hate america"" or ""the conservative nazi agenda"".  we have the duty as thinking americans, in the most advanced free country in the world, in these modern times of massive amounts of free information, to stop paying attention to this garbage.  get the facts and stop relying on a figurehead to spoon feed you your opinions
"
125,"flynn offers up a fast-paced, if unbelievable story.  unfortunately, character development is paper thin and clearly portrays flynn's political preferences.  characters, like rapp, with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles, have all the answers and are always showing those good-for-nothing politicians how the ""real world"" works.  meanwhile, flynn's politicians (the majority of whom are democrats) seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election.  while there are grains of truth in his characters, flynn consistently goes for the cheap, partisan stereotype.  i was looking for a well-developed political/military thriller.  i'm still looking.
"
1722,"mr. shirley sneaks into iran, hiding in the box of a truck, where he should have stayed.  he spends 3 or 4 days in iran, most of it trying not to be seen.  he walks around for a few hours. he speaks to 3 or 4  truckdrivers, 2 or 3 shopkeepers, and a few assorted others, from which he  assembles a complete picture and understanding of the political and social  infrastructure of iran.  along the way he explains, on just about every  other page, how the cia is a complete failure in every facet of it's  existence, how all the career people in it's employ are arrogant idiots who  are devoid of all compassion and intellect.  he explains each of the cia's  mistakes, along with his explanation of what they ought to have done. he  is, of course, ex cia himself, having left it because no one there  understood anything about anything
"
146,"the author is a journalist, but he seems straight out of the chamber of commerce or a right-wing think tank. like business elites, the author basically does not particularly like democracy. in his view societies should be run by elites from several areas - even authoritarians if needed. he is a proponent of constitutional liberalism, based on laws, rights, especially property rights, separation of powers, with much of that power being held in unelected bodies, and most of all free-market capitalism. he finds that set of conditions to be far more important than the exercise of democracy. his low regard for democracy is easily seen in his minimal interest in the manner in which a society of laws is created or even its exact nature and who benefits. most in the west do care. rights and legal systems are not neutral: the manner of construction determines relative winners and empowerment. 

though the author's real target is us society, he looks at the results of democracy over the world. and of course, he finds plenty of examples where democracy doesn't work. a country in the grip of fanatics will invariably elect and support leaders who are little concerned with rights and legalisms. but it is ridiculous to imply that those situations have any bearing on democracy in the us. 

in the us, the author is most concerned with what he calls the democratization of society over the last fifty or so years. in actuality, he is focusing on mass culture that is spread through mass consumption as vigorously promulgated by globalizing capitalism. in this era, elites in finance, business, law, banking, health care, various media, etc have likewise been swept up, in fact are the driving force, in a money-first culture. he contends that such elites once had an ethos of service and basically kept our democracy on track via subtle pressures on the masses. it is simply a cynical misrepresentation to hold that massive shopping at wal-mart and the like represents democratic empowerment. the actual test of democracy would be the ability of a community to stop the wal-mart juggernaut. 

he especially decries direct citizen actions. he is correct to observe that referenda and initiatives have had unintended consequences, often being usurped by special interests with deep pockets. however, he little notes that citizens have taken those routes due to the unresponsiveness of legislative processes. it's hard to take seriously the stance that the robber barons of the late 19th century, and their heirs, should be viewed as elites who kept our democracy on course, after bribing entire state legislatures as well as members of congress to accumulate vast sums. if citizens had actually been democratically empowered, such distortions of the political process could have been prevented. the theme that cash sanitizes crooks is as american as apple pie. his view that such unelected bodies as the supreme court and the federal reserve board prevent illiberal democracy is also questionable. who could be unaware of the politicization of those bodies: the embarrassing handling of the presidential election of 2000 or the cheerleading role of the fed during the stock market bubble of the late 1990s benefiting financial elites? no, rule by elites has very frequency distorted and usurped democracy, not buttressed it. 

if the author put journalism first, instead of being an apologist for 21st century capitalism, he would note the death grip that corporations now have over our society and the political process, actually foiling democracy. first and foremost that control is solidified through the mass media and the education system, distorting and muting all challenging ideas. it is not surprising that americans have been unable to mount any significant challenge to this latest version of laissez-faire, free-market capitalism that is involved in such harmful developments as free-trade agreements, worker visa programs, massive immigration, out-of-control energy policies, broken health care systems, huge cutbacks in various safety net programs, massive redistribution of wealth upwards, the gutting of our manufacturing base, etc. the list could go on. informed, empowered citizens would not permit this system of corporate rule to exist. the us most decidedly is not in a state of too much democracy, but is in the throes of democratic failure, which election hoopla very conveniently disguises periodically. this is the story of democracy that the author chooses to ignore. 

it is surprising to see the fairly high ratings of this book. americans are supposedly fiercely democratic. yet here is a book that clearly advocates elite rule, even anti-democratic generals if need be. the book is really worth reading only to see the willingness of some to contain citizen empowerment.

1579,"kurzweil opens with a very heartfelt recounting of his return to judaism and his personal path which led him to rabbi steinsaltz. from there the chapters fly by effortlessly, partitioned in small chapters of which each is it's own midrash, giving each of us something to reflect upon and discuss. this is for everyone who wants to know more about not only steinsaltz, but the beauty and wisdom of the jewish faith

563,"one reviewer claims that this is marred by some of eliot's unfurtunate preducices. but how come you don't say something like that about o' henry. we can't just stop reading authers because you we don't like their views. someone calls hemingway looking forward? if that's looking forward i'de rather look backward. hemingway has no concept of lyricism what so ever. most of the people that reviewer named justly loved eliot. eliot is not looking nesscarily towards the past, but towards what we have made out of the present. in name of progress, we have destroyed nature and good part of our souls. to call eliot conservative at the time he wrote the poem would be redicoulous, the first draft according to one of eliot's biographers, was absolutly a expression of relavtism. one critic accused him being a nihilist. 

   on the poem itself eliot is truly a master at evocating mode and tone, not to mention his brilliant use of imperfect rymthe. so it doesn't have the crepty sentimentalism and redicoulous forays of expression of eariler and later poets. so he looks at his poetry with a sense of hard classicism, we could use more of that. yet what he doesn't right he evoces through mode and tone, giving us truly one of the best poems of this, or any other century.

1129,"when i read alpha male syndrome, i saw myself and the many ""alphas"" i've worked with in high-tech corporate america.  in some instances i could call out the names of those i'd either worked with or had family relationships or friendships with - based on the alpha types, strengths and risk behaviors so well defined in this book.   i found the practical tips - encouraging specific change, in those who don't seem open to changing - to be useful, hopeful, encouraging and sometimes even funny.  i may go broke sending alpha male syndrome to my too-many alpha friends and more importantly to those who work or live with them!

from soup to nuts i enjoyed recognizing and knowing myself better through the book and from taking the author's online alpha assessment - then following the action steps in the book, and updated online alpha tips.  i can see how and why ms. ludeman and dr. erlandson's approach to executive coaching is effective.  
"
1953,"this book bears litthe relevance to the 'original' fourth edition book of the same name. there is no coordination with the text. most of the concepts are explained in terms of economics not computer science, i have to wonder if the whole idea is a gross mistake or a scam. i feel cheated
"
1172,"i had never read a danielle steel book before, and decided to give her a try, given that she is so popular and has so many books published. i was pretty disappointed. i agree with the other reviewers that the plot is unrealistic; however, if a book is unrealistic but well-written and engaging, i would still like it. i think the biggest problem with this book is the author's excessive repetitiveness. yes, i get that this character is really cold and unloving---that was already covered 50 pages ago! in addition, character traits could have been better conveyed through situations, rather than simply stating, ""so and so was a devoted mother"" and repeating this fact again and again and again. these flaws in the author's writing kept me skipping through whole sections of the book. this book did not leave me wanting to read more of ms. steel's books. it is an ok book if you like romance and very easy, repetitive reading.
"
1083,"i am a fan of tanya huff and the series of books with henry and victoria.  but this one is not it.  while henry is there he is such a minor character. the main character is tony foster a homosexual street kid who tanya should have left on the street.  i was totally bored and read the book through because i was hoping it would get better, then i was happy when it was over.  the plot idea was great, but it was not developed well and left me wanting for something more.  i was expecting henry to be a major player like he was with victoria, but no, he is relegated to tony's homosexual vampire lover who helps tony out.
  disappointing. dull.  i won't read the rest of this series, the tony foster series.
hey, tanya, how about a series of henry fitzroy, i would read that
"
1717,"i had to read this book for a political theory class in college.  after talking with several other members i was happy to find out that i do not have the reading skills of a third grader...benhabib goes out of her way to use vocabulary words that most educated people are not familiar with.  the book is also not organized well.  in order to really understand this book you will have to read it while taking notes.  points that could be grouped together for arguments are scattered throughout entire chapters and even the whole book.  benhabib may have used her vocabulary and lack of organization as tools to hide that the points she makes are not very well argued.  throughout much of the book benhabib is trying to shoot down the theories of john rawls and other theorists to support her views on migratory rights.  to be honest, i disagree with her views and admit that i might have found her organization and vocabulary more tolerable if i agreed with her.  still, i do not have a problem with her making these claims if she did so logically.  much of her work is based on telling the reader why other people are wrong and she will use theories she supposedly already disproved in one arguement to justify her later arguments for disagreeing with other theories.  

in short, i do not think anyone would want to read this book for pleasure, or intellectual curiosity.  if you have to read the rights of others for a class, i extend my condolences.
"
1370,"very politically manipulative primer that only gives 5/8 of the story. i add 1/8 because the author does acknowlege some of the huge problems caused by unbridled global capitalism, but then quickly glosses them over basically saying that these effects are unfortunate, but that free global trade is best for everyone in the long run. there is a lot of interesting incidental information as various terms are explained, but too often this reference becomes a one-sided sermon for free trade. these are the same deceptions that robert reich started pushing under clinton. repubs kept the song going without missing a beat. most of both dem and repub reps support neoliberal policies - the rich get richer in both parties. feel free to read to learn about terms, just be aware that the author is leading you down a highly biased path
"
143,"this book is outdated for the 21st century. the basics are there and in great detail but most of the information is useless for today
"
1415,"this book is an excellent guide to building and managing an investment portfolio.   it doesn't promise that you'll make millions. . . but it does provide the principles and strategies you need to create an investment portfolio for long-term growth. it's intelligent, easy to understand, and practical. 
"
765,"paul johnson has written a 1,000-page book about various and sundry aspects of the years 1815-1830, years in which he rightly claims to find the origins of many aspects of the world as we know it today.  johnson's chosen foci are certainly broad: he ranges from events in politics and law to music, science, and even opium use.  while almost every page is loaded with fascinating morsels of information that will certainly come in handy when you want to impress people at your next social function, johnson's roving eye and pen can be disconcerting: he tends to shift topics very quickly and without warning.  also, while the book claims to be about ""world society,"" johnson spends the largest part of his time talking about british society -- but he's found plenty of ways to range geographically from the ""western"" united states (like kentucky) to china and singapore.  throughout, his prose is generally crisp and pleasant to read.  

overall, johnson has given us what might be the ultimate in bedtime reading: a vast book that one can pick up, open nearly at random, and learn something interesting about the past but which retains significance today
"
428,"this is the worst textbook i have ever bought for any class!  it is a huge waste of money and super frustrating to read.  this book is horribly written.  the explanations are boring, drawn out, and unclear.  the early chapters draaaag on forever.  the later chapters get a little better, but they state a lot of obvious or useless information.  i have spent hours and weeks studying from this text and learned very little.     
"
353,"i must agree with some other reviewers of this book, and say that it is a very dry list of factual data, interspersed with bill wyman's moans and boasts. his gripe with allan klein about money seems to be quite valid, but he mentions it about a thousand times. mick and keith get quite a pasting- again it seems quite valid, but do we need to hear it so many times?    bill opines that keith richard's voice is weak and that his own songs were ignored by the band. listen to his only self-penned stones track of the 60s, on &quot;satanic majesties&quot;, and you will conclude that this is quite a self delusion- his voice is far weaker, and his songwriting at that time was also inferior.     the book seems to be more authoritative on dates, but we can only take bill's accuracy on faith. my knowledge of the stones is not enormous, but even i can see some big factual errors. for example he tells us that neither taj mahal nor marianne faithfull recorded songs for the &quot;rock n roll circus&quot;. a recent re-issue has proved him completely wrong.      as another reviewer rightly said, marianne faithfull's autobiog is a much better read
"
215,"although everything is shown in silhouette, there is plenty of color and action and my kids (boy and girl; now 3 and 5) have always like it.  there are herds of elephants, steaming machines, flowers, critters and more.  

as the first spotlight reviewer did a good job of summarizing the assortment of critters and things that one can find i won't say more.

but in regards to the use of silhouettes instead of pictures or detailed line drawings at least one reviewer has said that they didn't like them.   but i think they miss the point.  the book is about *shapes* and how much you *can* identify without the `advantage' of a detailed picture.  and looking at the silhouette and identifying the item/creature is part and parcel of the mental exercise, just like the rhythm and rhyme of the story.  if you used pictures you'd hardly learn anything about `shapes' would you.

no, the use of shadows is just right for exercising young minds.  for reaching for that aristotelian abstract (lol) of what is `skunk'.   and it is amazing how even the littlest of people can tell a skunk from a cat even with seuss' odd artwork.

five stars.  19 pages of fun for boys and girls.  this sturdy boardbook is a good read-aloud that stretches the imagination
"
458,"this book can be very damaging if you approach it with the idea that it is absolute truth.  as some readers have complained, this is not really a ""christian"" book because the focus isn't on christ, it's on you.  

a biblically centered way of dating would put the focus on loving other people unconditionally, the way jesus would, and not on trying to ""find the perfect spouse.""  the whole premise of the book is rather un-christlike:  making yourself enticing enough to the opposite gender that someone would want to marry you.  it's rather selfish, really, when you consider the words of john the baptist: ""christ must become more, i must become less,"" as well as the warning in song of solomon ""do not awaken love until it so desires.""  

shouldn't our primary goal be to glorify christ and not search for earthly shortcuts to fulfilling our desires?  finding a spouse is not like science nor business which have clear procedures or even guidelines.  hearts can be broken, and therefore authentic, christlike love must take precedence.  i don't mean to sound accusing, but this book borders close to the type of manipulation that the world cleverly calls ""seduction.""

my brother humorously commented that the book also tries to turn you into a ""poser."" this happens when 'forcing yourself' to be more masculine or feminine in order to entice the opposite sex.  you have to ask:  what kind of people are you trying to attract...people who are enticed by your masculinity/femininity or people who are excited about you for who truly are?  i personally would rather a lady be attracted to me for my fruits of the spirit than my looks or personality.

it is a combination of both action and faith that is important.  faith to set the situations up.  action to knock em down

1436,"fifteen years ago i purchased this book for the first time. today i am buying it as a gift for my son. i feel i am giving him the gift of life all over again.  even though i raised all my children with vitamin c added to their diets, he seems to have fallen off the &quot;juice&quot; wagon!  linus pauling was not only brilliant but clear and concise.  i only wish i had known he published a book on quantum mechanics a long time ago.  i shall purchase that too at last and maybe i shall have an inkling of what it is all about

1908,"i read the hundred penny box when i was in third grade 13 years ago.  its messages of love and memory have stayed with me and will continue to do so forever.  i have created my own hundred penny box and just made one for a friend's newborn son.  my grandfather was recently diagnosed with altzheimers, an illness i assume that great-great-aunt dew suffered from.  i took my ratty old copy of the book to his house over easter.  we read it together and discussed his own memories over the years.  while his memory is fading, i felt it important to hear them myself, love them, and save them in my own memory as michael did for aunt dew.  i would reccomend this book to any child who is losing a grandparent and anyone who needs a good, heartwarming story

1861,"``people  say again and again that philosophy  doesn't really progress, that we  arestill occupied  with the same philosophical problems as were  thegreeks.but  the people who say this don't understand why ishas to be  so. it is becauseour language has remained the same and  keeps seducing us  into asking the same questions.  as longas there continues to be a verb  'to be' that  looks as if it functions in the same way as 'to eat' and  'to  drink', as long as we stillhavethe adjectives  'identical', 'true',  'false', 'possible',as  long as we continueto talk of a river of time, of  an expanseof  space, etc., etc., people will keepstumbling over the  samepuzzling  difficulties and find themselves staring atsomethingwhich  no explanation seems capable of clearing up.and what'smore,this  satisfies  a longing for the transcendent, because, insofar  as peoplethinkthey can  see `the limits of human  understanding', theybelieve of course thatthey  can see  beyond these.`` 

''philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of ourintelligence by means of language``

``ambition is the death of  thought'''

these three quotes are from ludwig wittgenstein who redefined philosophysome70 years ago (but most people have yet to find this out).dennett, though he has  been a philosopher for some40 years, is one them. it is also curious that both he and his prime antagonist, john searle, studied under famous wittgensteinians (searle with john austin, dennett with gilbert ryle) but searle got the point and dennett did not. dennett is a hard determinist(though he trys to sneak  reality in the back door), and perhaps this is due to ryle, whose famous book 'the concept of mind'(1949) continues to be reprinted.  that book did a great job of exorcising the ghost but it left the machine.  dennett enjoys  making  the mistakes wittgenstein, ryle(andmany others since) have exposed in detail. 

byaccident,just before this book, i had  read ''the minds i'', which dennett coauthored withdouglas hofstadter in 1981. they made some bad  mistakes(see my review), and saddest of all, they reprinted  twofamous articles that pointed the wayout of the mess---nagel's `what is  like to be a bat?` and an early version of john  searle's chinese room argument explaining why computers  don't think.

 nagel pointed out that we do noteven know how to recognize whata concept of a bat's mind would be  like.  searle similarly explained how we lack a way to conceptualize  thinking  and how itdiffersfrom what a computer does(eg,it can translate chinese  without understanding it). likewise, we lack a clear test for recognizing  what countsas good  vs bad--or just intelligible-- for many philosophical and scientific concepts. our  use of the words consciousness, choice, freedom, intention,  particle, thinking, determines, wave,cause, happened,  event(and so on endlessly) are  rarely a source of confusion  but as soon as we leave normal life and enter philosophy(and anydiscussion detached from the environment  in  which language evolved) chaos reigns. wittgenstein  was the first to understand why and to point out how to avoid  this. unfortunately, he died inhis prime, his works are composed almost entirely of a series of examples of  how the mind(language)  worksand he never wroteany popular books,  so  understanding of his work is restricted to a very few. 

searle  is one of the world's leadingphilosophers and has written  manyextremely clear  and highly regarded articles and books,some of which have pointed out the  glaring defects in dennett'swork.his review ``consciousness explained  away'' of dennetts 1991 book`'consciousness explained'' and his book''the mystery of consciousness'' are very well  known,and show, in a way that isamazingly clear for philosophical writing,why neither dennett(nor any of the  hundreds of philosophersandscientists who have written on this topic)havecome closetoexplaining the hard problem--ie, how do you conceptualizeconsciousness.many suspect we will never be able to conceptualizeany of the reallyimportant things, but it isclear that we are  nowhere near it now. dennett has mostly  ignored his critics but has favored  searle with vituperative personal attacks.searle has been accused by dennett and others of  being out to destroy cognitive psychology which is quite funny as modern philosophy is(mostly) a branch of cognitive psychology and searle has made it very clear for 30 years that we are a good example of a biological machine that is conscious, thinks, etc,.  he just points out that we don't have any idea how this happens.   searle characterizes as ''intellectualpathology'',the views ofdennett andall those who denythe existence of thevery phenomena they setout to explain. dennett repeats his  mistakes here andleaves his reply to his critics to the penultimate page of  the book, where we are told that they areall mistaken and it is a waste of spaceto show how! unsurprisingly, there isnot one reference towittgenstein or searle in theentire book.there arehowever, many references to other old schoolphilosophers who are as confusedas he is. 

like most people, it does not cross his mindthatthe very inference engineshe thinks with are forcinghim to cometo  certainconclusions and that these will oftenbe quite  unconnectedwith or wrong about the way things are in the  world. they are a jumble of evolutionary curiositieswhich do various tasks in organizing behavior that were useful for survivalhundreds of thousands of years ago.wittgenstein was a pioneerin doingthought experiments in cognitive psychologyand beganto elucidate the nature of these engines and the subtletiesof language in the 30's, and thus he made the sorts of commentsthat this review begins with. 
dennett says(p98)that  his view is compatibilism, ie, that  free will(whichi hopewe can equate with choice) is compatible with  determinism(ie, that''there is at any instant exactly one physically  possible  future''--p25). he wants to show that determinism is not the same as inevitablity. however, the whole book is smoke  and mirrors by means of  which choice, in the sense we normally  understand it, disappears and we are  left with ``choice``,  which is something we cannot choose. naturally, this  echoes  the fate of consiousness in his earlier book ``consciousness  explained``. 

it is remarkable that, at a time when we are  just beginning to  reach the point where we might be able to understand the basics of how a  single neuron works(or how an  atom works for that matter), that anyone should  think they can  make the leap to understanding the whole brain and to explain  its most complex phenomena. please recall the last sentence of wittgenstein  from the opening quote: ''and what'smore,this satisfies a longing for thetranscendent, because, insofar aspeoplethinkthey can see `the limits of  human understanding',theybelieve of course thatthey can see beyond  these.`` the  relation between language, thought and reality is  extraordinarily complex and everyone gets lost. if one is very, very  careful,some understanding is possible, but dennett throws caution to  the  winds and we are dragged into the quicksand. 

there are  at least 3 different  topics here(evolution of our brain, choice  and morality) and dennett tries  vainly to weld them together into  a coherent account of how freedom evolves  from the deterministic  crashing of atoms. there is, however, no compelling  reason to  accept that bouncing atoms (or his favorite example, the game  of  life running on a computer) are isomorphic with reality.  he knows that  quantum indeterminacy(or the uncertainty principle)  is a major obstacle to  determinism however defined(and has  been taken by many as an escape to  freedom) but dismisses  it due to the fact that such events are too rare to  bother  with. by extension, its unlikely that any such  event will happen now or even in our  whole lifetime in our  brain, so we appear to be stuck with a determined  brain(whatever  that may be). however, the universe is a big place and its been  around a long time(perhaps forever) and if even one such quantum  effect occurs  it would seem to throw the whole universe into  an indeterminate state. the  notion ''there is at any  instant exactly one physically possible future''  cannot be true  if at any instant a quantum indeterminacy can occur--in this  case  there would seem to be infinitely many possible futures. this  recalls  one of the escapes from the contradictions of physics--each  instant our  universe is branching into infinitely many universes. 

he correctly rejects the idea that quantum indeterminacy gives us the answer to how we can have choice.  this obvious idea has been suggested by many but the problem is that nobody has any idea how to specify an exact sequence of steps which starts with the equations of physics and ends up with the phenomena of consciousness(or any other emergent phenomenon).  if so, they will definitely win at least one nobel prize, for not only will they have explained consciousness, they will have explained the universal phenomenon of emergence(how higher order properties emerge from lower ones). so, they would have to solve the 'easy' problem(to determine the exact state of the brain corresponding to some mental state and preferably specify the exact position of all the atoms in the brain over time-ignoring uncertainty) and the 'hard' one(what exactly correlates with or produces consciousness or choice etc?). and while they are at it how about also doing the  impossible--an exact and full solution to the quantum field equations for a brain.  it is very well known that these equations are uncomputable, even for one atom or a vacuum, as it would require an infinite amount of computer time.  but infinite will do for one atom so maybe a brain will take no longer. 

he starts off on the  first page appealing to the laws of  physics for protection against fantastic  notions such as immaterial souls, but physics is made of notions just as  fantastic(uncertainty,  entanglement, wave/particle duality, schrodinger's  dead/alivecat etc) and as feynmann said many times ``nobody understandsphysics!'' many think nobody ever will. 

on pg  2 he says  our values have little to do with the goals of our cells and  on pg 2  to3 that our personality differences are due to how  our ''robotic teams are  put togther, over a lifetime of  growth and experience.`` this is a bald  dismissal of human  nature, of the abundant evidence that our differences are  to  a large extent programmed into our genes and fixed in early  childhood, and  is typical of his constant confused wandering  back and forth between  determinism and environmentalism.

on page  9 he notes that free will is a problem and our  attitudes to  it make a difference, but for whom? nobody but philosophers. we make choices. what's the problem?  one has to step  outside life to experience a problem and then  everything becomes a problem.  what are consciousness, pain,  yellow, intention, matter, quarks, gravity  etc.? i doubt that  anyone has ever experienced a fundamental change in their  interactions  with people or their decision making processes due to their  thinking about choice. this shows that there is something  strange about such questions. wittgenstein would probably say that the language games are  different. there are games  for language connected with the cognitive  templates for decisions  or seeing colors etc, and thinking philosophically is operating them in decoupled mode. decoupled modes permit  thinking about the past, planning for the future, guessing  the mental states  of others, etc, but if one takes the results  in the wrong way and starts to  think `'john will try to steal  my wallet'', rather than just imagining that  john might  do it, confusion enters and those who cannot turn off the decoupled  mode or distinguish it from coupled mode,  enter the realm of pathology. some aspects of schizophrenia and other mental illness might be  seen this way--they lose control of which mode they are in, eg, notbeing able to see the  difference between the motives people  have and the motives they might have. 

one can then see  much of the philosophizing people do as operating in  these  decoupled modes but failing to be able to keep in front of them  the  differences from the normal mode. normal mode--eg, what  is that lion doing--  was undoubtedly the first one evolved  and decoupled modes--what did that lion  do last time or what  does he intend to do next--evolved later. this was  probably  never a problem for animals--any animal that spent too much  time  worrying about what might happen would not be very successful  contributing to  the gene pool. it is interesting to speculate that only when humans developed  culture and began degeneratinggenetically, could large numbers of people  survive with genes that  led them to spend alot of time in decoupled modes.  hence, we  have philosophy and this book, which is mostly about running the  decision templates in decoupled mode where there are no real  consequencesexcept earning royalties for putting the results  in a book for other people to  use to run their engines in decoupled mode.' let us alter wittgenstein's quote to read:  ''as longas there continues to be a verb 'to decide'  that looks as if it functions in the same way as 'to  eat' and 'to  drink',as long as we continueto talk of  freedom of action, of saying i  wish i had done otherwise,  etc., etc., people will keepstumbling over the  samepuzzling  difficulties andfind themselves staring atsomethingwhich  no  explanation seems capable of clearing up.''

as withmost philosophy books, nearly every page, often every paragraph,  changes from one type of language  game to another without  noticing that now one would have to be joking or  dreaming  or acting in a play or reciting a story , etc, and not actually  intending anything nor describing an actual situation in the  world. on page  10 he says we count on free will for the  whole way of thinking about our lives,  like we count on food  and water, but who ever, outside philosophy, standing in  front  of lunch counter full of food, ever thinks how fine it is that  they  have free will so they can pick coke instead of mineral  water? even if i  want to be a serious compatibilist and  try thinking this in decoupled mode, i  have to exit and  enter nondecoupled mode to make the actual choice. only then  can i go back to decoupled mode to wonder what might have  happened if i had  not had the ability to make a real choice.  wittgenstein noted how pretend  games are parasitic on real ones(this is not a trivial observation!).  the ability to engage in very complex  decoupled scenarios  is already evident in 4 year old children. so i would say  that normally, nobody counts on having choice, but rather we just choose. 


on the same page he shows again that he does not grasp cognitive  basics.  he says we learn to conduct our lives in the conceptual  atmosphere of choice,  and that `'it appears to be a stable  and ahistorical construct, as eternal  and unchanging as arithmetic,  but it is not.'' and on page 13--''it is an  evolved creation  of human activity and beliefs''. the whole thrust of  cognitive  psychology is that we do not learn the basics of planning, deciding,  promising, resenting, etc, but that these are built-in functions  of the  inference engines that work automatically and unconsciously  and start running  in very early childhood. there is no evidence  that they change as we grow,  or are in any way subject to  our beliefs,only  that they mature just as our body does. 

on pg 14 he suggests  its probable that our having free will depends on our believing  we have  it!  do we believe we see an apple, feel a pain, are  happy? the language  game of belief is very different from  that of knowing. we can believe we have  a dollar in our  pocket but if we take it out and look at it we can't  meaningfully  then say that we still believe it(except as a joke etc.). the  inference engine can run in decoupled(belief) mode so we can  imagine havingchoices or making them, but in life we just make them and it is only in very  odd situations we can say  that we believe we made a choice. but dennett is  saying thisis the universal case. if making a choice had any dependence on belief than so would everything everything else--consciousness,  seeing,  thinking,etc. if we take this seriously(and he says 'the serious problems of  free will' ) then we are getting  into trouble and if we actually try to apply  it to life, then madness is minutes away. 
. 
on page 65 et seq., he  discusses causation, intention and the `informal predicates'  that we use to  describe atoms etc, but cognitive resarch has  shown that we describe all  objects with a limited number of  ontological categories which we analyse with  our intuitive physics  modules and that when agents (ie animals or people or  things  like them--ie, ghosts or gods) are involved we use our  concepts (engines)  for agency, intuitive psychology, social minds, etc to  decide  how to behave. there is almost certainly no causation module  but  rather it will involve all of these and other inference  engines, depending on  the precise situation. discussing  possibility and necessity is much  easier if  one talks in terms of the output of our modules for intuitive  physics,  agency, ontological categories etc. of course there is no mention  here of wittgenstein's many incisive comments on causation,  intention,  deciding, nor of searle's now classic works  on intention and social reality. 

he spends much time on  ainslie's book 'breakdown of will', in which is  discussed  the hyperbolic discounting faculties (ie, inference engines) by which  we evaluate probable outcomes.
hemakes much of the excellent work of robert frank on altruism, emotion and economics, but the book he cites was 15 years old when this book was published. it was bingham's idea, amplified by frank and by boyd and richardson (1992) that  cooperation  was greatly stimulated by the evolution of means for punishing cheaters. he suggests these as examples of darwinian approaches  that areobligatory and promising. indeed they are, and  in fact they are standard  parts of economic, evolutionary  and cognitive theory, but unfortunately, he  makes little reference  to the other work in these fields. all that work tends to show that people do not choose but their brains choose for them. he does not establish any convincing connection between this work and the general problem of choice. 

onpg 216 he says that making oneself so  that one could not have  done otherwise is a key innovation in  the evolutionary ascent to free will,  and that we can only  be free if we learn how to render ourselves insensitive  to  opportunities. but where this ability resides is not revealed  for  several chapters! dennett has a penchant for hiding  his ideas in a massive  amount of rather irrelevant text.  again, he gets things backwards, as there is  a vast body of  very good evidence from biology and psychology that we are get  the feelings that we should behave in some way from our inference engines and  these are not provided by some part of our conscious  self, but by the automatic and unconscious operation of the  engines. as he notes, hundreds of experiments  with the prisoner's dilemma  and related protocols have shown how easy it is to  manipulate  people's choices and that their calculations are not conscious  and  deliberate at all. when the situation is manipulated to  make them conscious,they are much slower and  less reliable. so, there has been  constant pressure of natural  selection to make the engines fast and automatic  and inacessible  to deliberate thought.

dennett says `we make ourselves'  so  that we could not do otherwise and that this is the basis  of morality and  choice. the evidence would seem to be exactly  the opposite. our inference engines give  us basic moral intuitions and  we generally act in accord with the results.  if we or others  do not we feel guilt, outrage, resentment etc, then cheater genes will invade the population and this is one of the main theories as to how a good part of morality evolved.our genes make us so we can't(mostly) do otherwise, not our will or whatever dennett thinks can do it.   we can often choose to do otherwise but our own  intuitions and the knowledge of social disapproval  usually serve to limit our choices. these intuitions evolved  in small groups between 50,000 and some  millions of years ago. in the modern world the intuitions are often not to  our  advantage and the social controls weak. this is a prime reasonfor the chaos in the world.

on pg  225 he finally sneaks in a definition of free will  as ''a complicated snarl of mechanistic causes that look likedecision making(from certain angles)''. he claims that thisplays all the valuable  roles of free will but lacks some  (unspecified) properties possessed by  traditional free will.  the smoke is thick but i  am pretty  sure one of those unspecified properties is what we understand aschoice. he insists(top pg 226) that his naturalistic  account of decision  making leaves plenty of room for moral  responsibility, but making ourselves so  we couldn't do otherwise  does not seem to describe the way we actually  function, nor  does it seem to leave any room for morality, as that would seem  to consist precisely in being able to do otherwise. 

he  does not propose  any test for deciding if a choice is voluntary  or forced and i doubt he could  do so. normally if someone  asks us to move our hand, we know what counts as  having a  choice, but, typical of philosophers, i expect that regardless  of  whether it moves or not he will count both as evidence for his position. 

at this point he also starts his discussion of libet's well known work on conscious attention which is the only part of the book that i felt was worth my time. 

on page 253 et seq., he sneaks in his definition of conscious will--the  ''brains user illusion  of itself''' which has as one of its main roles  providing  ''me with the means of interfacing with myself at other times``.  and ``illusory or not, conscious will is the persons guide  to his or her own  moral responsibility for action.`` he says  the trick we need is to see that  ``i`' control what is happening  inside the ''simplification barrier''...  ''where decision  making happens''. ``mental events'' become conscious by  ''entering  into memory''. ''the process of self description... is  what we  are''. the crucial thing is that choice is possible  because the self is  distributed over space(the brain) and time(memories).  he realizes this is  going to leave many incredulous(everyone who can follow this and really understands!). ''i know that many  people find it hard to graspthis idea or take it seriously. it seems to them  to be a trickwith mirrors, some kind of verbal slight of hand that whisksconsciousness, and the real self , out of the picture just when it was about to  be introduced.'' many will say he took the words out of their mouth, but i would  say it's incoherent and  thateverythingwe know about consciousness and the whole  universe(making the obvious extensions of such claims)  was gone long beforewegot this far. 


on pg 259 he says that culture has made us rational animals!  this is a stunning denial of human nature(ie, genetics and evolution) coming from the person who wrote 'darwin's dangerous idea''!  presumably he is talking about his idea that it is memories spread over space(the brain and other people) and time that give us choices and morals and consciousness(line 6 from bottom).  he says consciousness is a user-interface but it is never made clear who or where the user is and how it interfaces with the brain(you will have to suffer through 'consciousness explained to find that there is no answer there either).  though he makes many references to evolutionary and cognitive psychology, he seldom uses any of the terminology that has been current for decades(social mind, intuitive psychology, coalitional intuitions etc) and clearly is not familiar with most of the concepts. if he means that we got the fine details of morality from culture, thats ok, but this is the icing on the cake and the cake was baked by the genes.  

we are also told here that r&d(by which he means evolution here, but other things elsewhere) has given us the self  and that language creates new kind of consciousness and morality.  i am sure that he will get little agreement on this.  it seems quite clear that consciousness and the basics of morality evolved in primates(and earlier) long before spoken language(though it is a very deep topic as to how language evolved from extant capacities in the brain).  he continues ``morality memes arose by accident some tens of thousands of years ago`` which would be ok if he meant the icing on the cake but he clearly means the cake!  and then he says the point of morality is not the survival of our genes, which is an amazing (and totally incorrect)thing to say, even if he was only referring to memes.  
on pg 260 he claims  that  because we do not comprehend our ''bland dispositions  to cooperate'', they  mean nothing to us, but it is the operation  of our templates that is  everything to us. there is ample  evidence that if one of them is damaged a  person cannot function  properly as a social being(eg, autism).  i would say it is the operation of the templates for intuitive psychology etc which lead dennett to the counterintuitive views that we do not have consciousness and choice in the way we think.  

he also says here that it was one of the major  evolutionary transitions when we were able to change our views and reflect on reasons for them. this again reflects his lack of understanding of evolutionary psychology.  i know of no evidence that the basic moral intuitions, like all the templates, are accessible to consciousness.  we may decide our cheating was justifiable, or forgive someone else's cheating, but we still know it was cheating(ie, we cannot change the engine). i suspect my ancestors a million years ago had the same feelings in the same situation but what has happened is that there are lots of other things that may be taken as relevant and that sometimes these will lead me to act contrary to my feelings.  another issue is that as culture developed, one had to make many important or 'moral type` decisions for which the engines were not evolved to give a clear answer.  

on pg 267 he says that we now replace our `free floating rationales'(probably corresponding to what cognitive psychologists call our templates or inference engines) with reflection and mutual persuasion. and on pg 286 he says that it is a child's upbringing --demanding and giving reasons-- that affects moral reasoning. again, he just has no grasp of what has happened in the last 30 years of research--the templates do not change with reflection or upbringing. we are then told again that consciousness makes moral issues available over time to the self, which takes responsibility.  it is not any more coherent or credible with repetition.  

on pg 289 he has a chapter summary which repeats the mistaken notions that it is culture that makes it possible to reflect and that choice depends on education(memory) and sharing.  it's clear that it is not culture but the inherited cognitive structures that make it possible to reflect and to choose and that culture determines the acceptable actions and their rewards or punishments. on pg 303 he discusses the classic philosophical barrier between 'ought'and 'is' , unaware that our templates solved that problem long ago--ie, they tell us how to feel about situations regarding other people.  he also seems to be unaware that there are hundreds of cultural universals implanted in our genes(eg see 'the blank slate'). 

he often starts into what looks like its going to be a good discussion of some issue in evolutionary psychology, but invariably wanders off into philosophical arcana and winds up with more confusion.  this happens on pg 261 where he states that concepts like 'praiseworthy' were shaped over millennia by culture, while most would say the basis for such concepts is in the genes and each culture only detetermines the details of acceptable reactions to the intuitions its members get from their innate mechanisms.   on pg 262 he tries to explain how an ess(evolutionarily stable strategy) can produce morality. his idea here is that genetic `r&d` produces dim understandings of morals and then culture(memetics) produces variations and clarifications.  i would say that we all know, and much research has made clear, that we commonly get very clear results from our inference engines and only dimly understand in special cases.  culture merely decides what we can do about our feelings.  

the last part of the book is mostly  concerned  with moral culpability. he refers to the legal classic by hart  and  honore, which i started reading 30 years ago since it's  authors were deeply influenced by wittgenstein.  dennett tells us that we have  control over our own morality and  that thinking about morality will improve us.  but, there seems  no justification whatever for this view in this book. there is nothing at  all  here to help anyone escape from the dictates of the monkey mind. it is a defensible point of view that those who manage this do so by traveling a spiritual path that  has no connection with philosophy- and there is not a hint of  spirituality in this entire book--another telling point considering that many mystics have fascinating things to say about the functioning of the mind. i find  more wisdom about how  to be free and moral in any of osho's 200 books than anywhere in philosophy. one rarely finds spiritually and morally  advanced people teaching at universities. there is no sign here, nor in  anything he has done, that dennett is morally superior. after 40 years of thinking about morality he launches personal attacks on his critics or arrogantly dismisses them.  it seems clear that, like all of us, he is trapped in the limits of his inference engines. 

so, how much opportunity is there to  improve our morality? it seems  clear(eg, see pinker's `the blank slate`) that  most of our behaviour  is genetic and the rest due to unknown factors in our  environment, in spite of the vigorous efforts of parents and religions and political parties. on  average, maybe 5% of the variation in moral behavior(variations are the only thing we can  study) is due to our own efforts. the moral choices that matter  most today are  those affecting the fate of the world. but our moral templates were not evolved to deal with overpopulation and the greenhouse effect. 

how remarkable it would be if just one of the hundreds of millions of educated people in the world managed to figure out what consiousness or choice or any mental phenomenon really is.  and if one did, we would expect them to be a scientist at the cutting edge of research using some exotic fmri  equipment and the latest parallel processing neural networked fuzzy logic computer etc.  but a philosopher or physicist just sitting there thinking, coming up with the solution to the greatest puzzle there is!  and then writing a whole book about it without checking with the sceptics first.  to return to the quote at the beginning--'ambition is the death of thought'.  indeed--though clearly wittgenstein was thinking of interesting thoughts

1512,"hacker's challenge 2 is a sort of practical exam for the hacking exposed series. hacker's challenge was a terrific book for putting some incident response and forensic skills to use and practicing for the real thing. hacker's challenge 2 continues the tradition and should be a must read for anyone who works with network security and incident response. the style of the challenges is fairly entertaining and the plots are so engaging you may not want to put the book down. its like a best-selling mystery novel for network security techies. it may not affect the quality of the book overall, but i preferred having the authors of the individual challenges identified as they were in hacker's challenge. however, you should definitely buy this book!

1881,"by chance before picking this up i had just finished the heart is a lonely hunter by carson mccullers, and was struck by the similarities and differences. it's a great ""compare and contrast"" pair, as an exercise for high-schoolers.

both are written as first-person accounts by teen-aged girls and are roughly contemporary. heart published in 1940, and castle in 1948, both about life in the 30s. 

both families are poor. in castle though, there is never any question that the girls might go off and get jobs. this is supposedly because they ""don't know how to do anything"". so instead they sell off their belongings and get by on scraps of bread and the odd bit of butter. how charming! they are ""eccentric"", which seems enough in the author's eyes to exempt them from the expectation of supporting themselves. only stephen the handsome young son of the late housekeeper, enamored of cassandra, does work and gives the family his entire salary. but he is of the class that is expected to toil after all. even he is rewarded in the end--able to avoid labor with an easy job similar to that of step-mum topaz--striking poses.

unlike the looming and grinding poverty of heart then, the poverty in the castle never amounts to more than a lark--educated folks playing at being poor until they're rescued by romantic circumstance. not so in america where mick kelly, who didn't know how to do anything either, went off to work at woolworth's, and to a life of little hope.

in castle the solution comes in the form of that classic deus ex machina, the inheritance. two dashing young wealthy americans one of whom has inherited the castle, show up just in time, with their chatty modern mum. they throw money around and talk too much, in the cliched extravagant american style. most of the remainder of the novel consists of cassandra and her sister rose swooning over one brother or the other, with an eventual romantic result that assures all the characters of economic well being.
 
it's all so very charming, bourgeois, and harmless. if your life is hard don't worry--a man will show up to rescue you!

the reviews for this novel in amazon are overwhelmingly positive. smith was obviously talented. her writing is elegant and a pleasure to read. i wish she had given cassandra a little more ambition.

you'll suffer for miles, and then cheer at the inevitable outcome.  ekaterin is no shrinking violet!  don't mess with her!  a civil campaign is a terrific read!

[a previous reviewer commented on the cover's inaccuracy in depicting mile's stature.  actually i believe the couple on the cover are meant to be emperor gregor and the lady laisa.  it's their wedding after all.  if that's the case then the cover would be okay.]

1189,"i couldn't read past the second chapter.  roberts is just perpetuating the same old stereotypes about muslims.  it really steamed me that she used a verse of the quran out of context for the title page of ""the bitter"".  ""your wives are your fields, so go to your fields as you like"" isn't meant as a justification of sexual abuse and has never been interpreted as so by real scholars of the quran.  i'm not going to finish this book, because i'd rather not be reminded of how much i am viewed as some sort of exotic, oppressed ""other"" type of woman, thanks.

1128,"this is a nearly verbatim rendition of the grimms' story, and it's hard to understand why zelinsky would use his talent to illustrate it for children. even harder to figure out is how the american library association could award its caldecott medal for distinguished american picture book for children to any rendition of this dreadful tale: the king threatens to kill the miller's daughter if she can't spin gold from straw. rumpelstiltskin saves her life by spinning gold for her, but extracts a necklace, a ring and, on the third night of spinning, a promise of her firstborn. she then marries the king, whom zelinsky depicts as young and handsome. when it comes time for the queen to hand over her newborn, rumpel agrees to relent if the queen can discover his name. she sends a servant to follow him into the woods and discover the name. so the king, though he looks good, is greedy and brutal. the queen is a victim who agrees to give over a future infant to save her own life, and then depends on an anonymous, unrecognized ""servant girl"" to save the child. and rumpelstiltskin, shown as physically unattractive and (the message seems to be) therefore bad, is the one who saved the future queen from execution and then relents on the payment he bargained for. a weird, twisted story that offers nothing for kids, illustrated with renaissance-style pictures that accentuate the perversity by making the bad guy look good and the guy who saved the damsel in distress look bad

1256,"i'm a big koontz fan and as is generally the case, i greatly enjoyed this story.  it was a little strange but that's to be expected from this author and genre.  that said, it starts off fairly quickly and flows well through most of the book.  it had the curious sense of near-division in that the book almost seemed to be separated into two distinct sections that were not, in my opionion, as well-connected as in many of koontz's other books.  in addition, the ending seemed a little hasty.  thus i gave it four rather than five stars.  that said, i would gladly recommend it to a friend as i would most any of this author's work

1775,"i have written a lengthier review of this work elsewhere. but i did want to say to potential readers that the peggy antrobus book is a brief and welcome introduction to the global women's movement, that as such it fills a long-felt-want, and that it is to be recommended to those new to, unfamiliar with, or who feel they should be allied with, the women's movement. it would - it will - make an excellent text for those doing women's studies, as to those doing social movement studies, whether globally or more locally. 

summarising, antrobus shows the women's movement as political, as recognising women's relationship to social conditions, as processal, as posed against patriarchal privilege, as beginning where and when women recognise their separateness and even their alienation, marginalisation, isolation or abandonment within wider movements for social justice or transformation.

one complaint, but which is much more widely spread than in this book alone. this is the avoidance of the word `capitalism' - even by feminists who are or were once socialists. capitalism does not even get an index reference in antrobus. capitalists, mostly after all male, white and patriarchal, call it capitalism, and are proud of it. so why cannot it not be so named by feminists, who could and surely should condemn it?  this cannot be solely because of their justified criticism of the archaic political-economic determinism of patriarchal socialists. so it has to be due to either a desire to be salonfähig (acceptable in the salons within which they have been speaking, to the funders they are dependent upon), or a restriction of their utopia to a kinder, gentler global capitalism, a global neo-keynesian order - for which no convincing feminist case has been made. pity

758,"i know a lot of people liked this book, but i felt like it put too much pressure on me to pack on the pounds.  i didn't realise so much of the book was focused on diet.  it says you should plan on gaining a pound a week, and the more you gain the healthier your babies will be.  well the first 13 weeks i managed to gain nothing, and i felt horrible about it, but food made me so sick the last thing i could do was eat more food to try to gain weight.  the book said that according to my starting weight i should try to gain 50 - 60 pounds during my pregnancy!  i decided to stop reading the book, and so far, just going by what my gut says about what to eat and when, i've managed to put on 20 pounds.  my twins are measuring perfectly and are very healthy.

this book isn't horrible, but i would check it out of a library or borrow it or buy it used, don't spend the $ on a new one... and be prepared to put it down if it doesn't sound right to you

290,"from a sociological perspective, hustlers, beats , and others serves what it set out to do, explore the sociological aspects of billiards in america and the culture that has accompained it through time. however with the  recent boom of billiards into mainstram american society, many of his  observations and conclusions are dated if  not false. te book just goes to  many places, crime, pornography, etc. and fails what it set out to  originally acomplish. furthermore, i find it quite unusal that the author  chooses to contend a great deal of current ideologies toward billiards . is  this not a sociological perspective, or an historical editorial.as a  college student, and a sociology major, the author fails to win my support  from his argument. all in all, quite disapointing as i found it at my local  bookstore and the cover looked interesting. i was left with a feeling of  disappointment when i finished this book, as it completely crushed many of  the idealization and ideologies and norms that are associated to theculture  of billiards. stick with the sociology, cut the editoria

1193,"clinton's old friend and key russia advisor provides insight on a number foreign policy topics as they evolve. as deputy secretary of state, his accounts provide personal, scholarly and practical accounts. the reader might determine both that talbott was an invaluable resource as the post-cold war era evolved, and that in the end, clinton was his own &quot;russia hand.&quot;
 
 the primary theme of the book is the relationship between clinton and russian president boris yeltsin. as they address issues such as nato expansion, the balkans, economic difficulties, and each president's own personal troubles, a number of lessons emerge. first, great power politics takes place between human beings, not merely among structural or organizational frameworks. second, the blending of idealism and realism is thorough and complex, they are not either-or options. third, political, military, economic, domestic and international issues all impact each other, often in surprising ways. fourth, watch out for the u in trying to explain policy making: in the generic y=ax+by+cz+u, that u (for unexplained/unexpected) can often play a large role. 
 
 the russia hand is valuable to students of foreign policy, russia and u.s.-russia relations, and the emergence of the post-cold war era.

"
323,"spend big bucks and hire the boston consulting group to help you with your strategy . . . and what do you get?  hardball answers that question indirectly through sharing classic strategies for achieving competitive and economic advantage employed by bcg clients.

as a result, i think this book will be most appealing to mbas thinking about working for bcg and potential clients who want to get a sense of what the outcome might be like.

for those who are well read in business strategy, this book will be a disappointment.  it focuses on very little you haven't read or thought about many times before.  skip this book if you are in this category.

the strategies discussed include overwhelming competitors with superior resources (frito-lay versus eagle snacks), adjusting to take advantage of what customers want more of (more variety and better delivery from wausau papers), threatening competitors' sources of profits (japanese auto makers go after the big 3's positions in minivans and suvs in north america), copy and improve on better business models (batesville casket applies automotive manufacturing techniques), encourage your competitor to retreat (attack the bottom of the market first in low margin categories and move up), refocus your business model on one set of advantages (carmax), acquire others to build your strengths while making competitors more vulnerable (masonite international), and change the nature of competition (get to low-cost sourcing earlier than competitors, secure low-cost assets sooner and play the wal-mart card carefully).  

the overall metaphor for the book has its problems.  if you play to win, you are playing hardball.  al dunlap (author of mean business) was a hardball guy, but it didn't pay off at sunbeam.

if i read past the words in the book, the concept they authors are advancing is one of being unrelenting in developing a strategy that creates a virtuous cycle of ever-expanding resources and advantages while creating a vicious cycle for competitors of ever-decreasing resources and advantages.  ""keep 'em down"" would have been a more accurate title for the book.

you will find scant information in the book about newer types of strategies, new forms of technology and new business paradigms.  this book is about ""rock 'em, sock 'em"" competition among the industrial giants of the world.  

i worked as a consultant and later as a project manager at bcg in the early 1970s, and i was struck that the kinds of strategies and clients described here have changed almost not at all since then.  i do think hardball better captures the classic bcg approach used in the early 1970s than any other book i have read published by the firm or its professional staff.  bruce henderson would be proud of you!

from my perspective, i graded the book down for slight inaccuracies in places such as underplaying the legal risks in these strategies (the authors seem to think scaring off competitors with ""signaling"" is pretty risk-free), misstating some of the cases (did gm really crush ford's ability to get investment grade bonds by pushing for zero percent financing? -- it looks more like mutual suicide to me), and praising more than was due in some cases (the japanese car companies were very late to come into north america with minivans and suvs).  i also thought the metaphor got in the way of the message . . . rather than enhancing it.

1090,"when i found ""hour game"" in paperback at our local library's monthly book sale, i thought i had hit pay dirt.  but i cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as ""the winner"" and ""absolute power"" could turn out such a dog.  long, boring, and confusing.  i fear that mr. baldacci hired an ""aspiring young writer"" to ""help"" him crank out a quick book. i cannot pass this book along to my friends -- i couldn't do that to them.  it will be tossed into our blue recycle bin.  what a waste.  what a shame.

1598,"after reading all the author's books so far, i realized he is repeating himself. in all his books (including the ones which myron bolitar isn't present) there are the same elements in the plot: disappeared person who might or not be dead, mobster guys who might or not be involved in the plot, the hero gets beaten by mosbter guys and is always saved ""in the last minute"", someone wealthy and with lots has interest in the plot but no one knows for sure. as the plots became being built upon the same structure, the suprise is getting less and less after each book.  being someone who started liking mistery books after reading all agatha christie's ones, and because each book of hers is completely diferent from the other, i look for the same originality in other mistery books.

of course the book is good for a first time harlan coben reader. i just didn't like it that much because of the repetitions, which make very easy to guess the final, spoiling the suspense of the reading

1727,"let's learn kanji is systematic, it gives you a wealth of basic kanji knowledge (including stroke order and radicals) as well as providing space to practice and regular worksheets/mini tests so you can monitor your progress! often kanji books offer only examples and written explanations, or focus soley on repeated written practice. the addition of the mini tests for consolidating your learning makes this book a must have. i studied some kanji previously but found my self directed study slow. while i agree with the other reviewer that the pace seem stedious at first, i after a month i can claim some serious progress! my only concern with this text is that from time to time the mini tests do not have an answer key. all in all an excellent book for self study by motivated beginners

1355,"a gold sticker on this book's cover reads &quot;winner of the nobel prize for literature.&quot;  don't be mislead. the sticker must refer to the author not the book.  while he no doubt received the prize, after wading through the work i can't believe it was for this piece of work.  i found the book exceedingly boring, a chore to read every step of the way.  as the iberian peninsula physically separates from europe, several unengaging and underdeveloped characters (the most interesting of which was a dog) wander from one destination to another with meager purposes, certainly none i cared about. while the book may have been intended as an allegory for portugal's relationship with the rest of europe and the european union, it failed to strike a chord.  i'll chalk this book up as something only a pulitzer prize judge would love

1448,"some of patterson's conclusions were a bit of a reach.
some of his segways weren't all that smooth.
but this book is just plain entertaining. it is chopped full of stories on rockstars making deals with the devil,lingering around after death, and backed up with just enough innuendo-ish research for it to almost be believable. well, some of it actually believable. patterson scribes on about various rockstar-occult alliances (in particular the rolling stones and led zeppelin) and uses quotes from the musicians themselves.

"
268,"i was really looking forward to reading this book since i am both a brain researcher and a professional musician. first it was highly disorganized and rambled from subject to subject without any real framework. much of what the author spoke of was not related to how the brain processes music but speaks to the way research is conducted. even this was sparse at best. he attempted to explain the elements of music so that the majority of people could understand it. however it became too watered down and even lost me. lastly the author was entirely too self congradulatory as to his own accomplishments. pushing the envelope of science should be  award enough. for these reasons i can not recommend this book

1918,"i purchased this commentary for an in-depth study that i was doing on wednesday evenings.  i carefully checked a bunch of commentaries on amazon, hoping to find the one that would help me with insights that i could share in the study.

unfortunately, this volume hasn't lived up to my hopes.  i didn't need something that would offer the obvious points (i can do that myself).  i was hoping for something that would offer insights into some of the more difficult and confusing passages, including thoughts on how those passages apply to our lives today.  i've been disappointed.  i am now well into the study and rarely even check the book anymore as i'm gathering information.

i was between this one and the carson commentary.  obviously, i think i made the wrong decision.  (not that there's anything theologically wrong in the text - it's just not what i was hoping for.

836,"if you don't know much more about woodrow wilson than an overview of the important events of his life, this book isn't going to help much. there's very little political analysis, almost no attempt to portray what diffiulties wilson needed to overcome, and no passion at all in the writing. actually this book feels a lot like a high school term paper that someone knew they had to write and just wanted to turn in for a passing grade. auchincloss talks a bit about the two wilsons (one good one bad) and hints at wilson's dependance on women, but neither of these positions is fleshed out or used consistently. maybe woodrow wilson's life is just too large for a book this small

914,"i was interested in dante's thoughts on hell, religion, and the afterlife as taught by the catholic church at the time of its writing.  what i got was a detailed political history of medieval italy.  this book is great for the first few chapters, but then it becomes a repetitive saga.  synopsis of the each chapter of the inferno: go to next layer of hell; describe in 20 words or less the torture found there; make fun of some political opponents, catholic church officials, and so forth; prepare for further descent.  in my opinion, this book resides somewhere between the 21st and 22nd layers of hell.  canto three pretty much has it right....

1743,"my boyfriend bought from the earth to the moon, and since he is an astrophysics student i expected that he would have enjoyed finding about people's conceptions about going to the moon at that early time.  he however summed up the book by saying that it contained a lot of basic things didn't make much sense. well, from a layman's perspective i found from the earth to the moon engaging.  it goes into the technical aspects of going to the moon and involves a reasonable amount of logic, physics and astronomy.  even from my scientifically deprived perspective, a lot of things in the book didn't make much sense, such as the actual method of getting to the moon, but this doesn't really take away from the book - it adds greatly to its appeal.  the book contained some bizarre bits of humour and its whimsical nature never bordered into the ridiculous. i was kept wondering how much of this was actually going to work, and what these poor souls were going to come up with next.  compared to twenty thousand leagues under the sea and even journey to the centre of the earth however, from the earth to the moon is noticeably less imaginative. verne uses everyday objects and ideas to make his ideas a reality, and much unlike his other works, doesn't stray far from the earthly. some people may feel cheated by the predictable conclusion, but all in all from the earth to the moon is a good read.  if you drop at the sight of f(x) = y, then this book is not for you because it involves some logical thinking, centripetal forces and the like which may be hard to assimilate.  if you really know your physics theory then you may not appreciate the book either because of the theoretical meanderings that may have limited basis today. if you, like me are somewhere in the middle of these two extremes then from the earth to the moon is definitely worth your time.

1184,"heinlein loads this book up with hooks in the early pages to catch your attention.  unfortunately, these hooks turn out to be superfluous and lead nowhere.  this shoddy technique is found in all four of hienlein's final books.  we are also treated to some of heinlein's stock characters, dirty old men, horny female computers, naked adolescent girls, and dominant beauties who would be right at home in leather and whips.  without these archetype characters most heinlein novels written after 1970 would have a sparse population indeed.  as if this isn't enough, heinlein drags in his usual cast of characters from his other novels as he is so prone to doing.  in spite of all their cameo appearances, this group remains dull and one dimensional throughout.  heinlein's earlier novels written prior to 1960 are still fine fare for young people, especially boys.  this novel, as well as most of heinlein's later work will be enjoyed primarily by a group of die hard fans and is definitely not for general consumption

294,"why read a book from 1857 which flopped so badly as commercial literature that melville stopped writing and ended his career as a customs official? because this book masterfully explores the entire nature of trust, confidence and cons. though the setting is a riverboat on the mississippi river just before the u.s. exploded into civil war, its insights cross cultural boundaries. 

this is not an easy book to read for several reasons. first, it is undoubtedly one of the first ""post-modern"" novels which breaks from traditional narrative storytelling. ( another example: dostoevsky's notes from the underground.) the confidence-man is a collection of 45 conversations between various people on the riverboat--beggars, absurdly dressed frontiersmen, sickly misers, shysters, patent medicine hucksters, veterans (of the mexican-american war) and the ""hero"" in the latter part of the book, the cosmopolitan. 

in typical melville fashion, you also get asides--directly to the reader, in several cases, as if melville felt the need to address issues of fiction outside the actual form of his novel. the lack of structure, action and conclusion make this a post-modern type book, but if you read each conversation as a separate story, then it starts to make more sense. 

for what ties the book together is not a story but a theme: the nature of trust and confidence. in a very sly way, melville shows how a variety of cons are worked, as the absolutely distrustful are slowly but surely convinced to do exactly what they vowed not to do: buy the ""herbal"" patent medicine, buy shares in a bogus stock venture, or donate cash to a suspect ""charity."" 

in other chapters, it seems like the con artist is either stopped in his tracks or is conned himself. since the book is mostly conversations, we are left to our own conclusions; there is no authorial voice wrapping up each chapter with a neatly stated ending. this elliptical structure conveys the ambiguous nature of trust; we don't want to be taken, but confidence is also necessary for any business to be transacted. to trust no one is to be entirely isolated. 

melville also raises the question: is it always a bad thing to be conned? the sickly man seems to be improved by his purchase of the worthless herbal remedy, and the donor conned out of his cash for the bogus charity also seems to feel better about himself and life. the ornery frontiersman who's been conned by lazy helpers softens up enough to trust the smooth-talking employment agency owner. is that a terrible thing, to trust despite a history of being burned? 

the ambuiguous nature of the bonds of trust is also explored. we think the cosmopolitan is a con-man, but when he convinces a fellow passenger to part with a heavy sum, he returns it, just to prove a point. is that a continuance of the con, or is he actually trustworthy? 

the book is also an exploration of a peculiarly american task: sorting out who to trust in a multicultural non-traditional society of highly diverse and highly mobile citizens. in a traditional society, things operate in rote ways; young people follow in their parents' traditional roles, money is made and lent according to unchanging standards, and faith/tradition guides transactions such as marriage and business along well-worn pathways. 

but in america, none of this structure is available. even in melville's day, america was a polyglot culture on the move; you had to decide who to trust based on their dress, manner and speech/pitch. the con, of course, works on precisely this necessity to rely on one's senses and rationality rather than a traditional network of trusted people and methods. so the con man dresses well and has a good story, and an answer for every doubt.

the second reason why melville is hard to read is his long, leisurely, clause upon clause sentences. but the book is also peppered with his sly humor, which sneaks up on you... well, just like a good con.

529,"this book is a disappointment.  it provides little insight into the life or personality of robert redford, the actor or the person.  the book is basically a chronicle of the movies rr has directed or in which he has appeared as an actor.  but even as a filmography the book fails.  the reader learns little about the creation of each movie or the relationships among the actors beyond the anecdotes that have been repeated numerous times on tv or in the press.  in addition, the authors have the annoying habit of consistently putting down robert redford with snide remarks.  there must have been something about the actor other than his white teeth and good looks that made him an international superstar.  for sure, it must be difficult to write a biography of such a private person as robert redford.  however, it is the responsibility of biographers to gather information and gain an understanding of their subject, and if they can't do so, then there is no book

1524,"i purchased this book several months ago. during that time i've tried several of the recipes - the french lentil soup is very good. the chili and corn biscuit casserole was unappetizing. the chili was so-so and the corn biscuits were too heavy to my taste. the recipe for mushroom, french lentil and chestnut ragu says to ""see glossary"" for the chestnuts but there's nothing in the glossary regarding chestnuts. it wasn't until i read another recipe (smoky chestnut and sweet potato soup) that chestnuts were discussed. the mediterranean salad sounds good on paper but was lackluster. far too much red onion (which my guests mostly picked out). although a number of the recipes are relatively simple there are several with very long lists of ingredients that take too much time and too many utensils to prepare. as someone who works full time, a 20-ingredient recipe holds very little allure, no matter how good it sounds. i had trouble finding some of the ingredients. for example, the author specifies several different types of squash which i haven't been able to locate at any of my local grocery stores or farmer's markets.  the book is organized in menus which are not listed in the table of contents. if you're looking for a specific recipe you'll have to spend some time with the index trying to locate it which is not convenient. the author definitely has some good ideas but this book probably will sit on my bookshelf more than on my countertop
"
1837,"pojman does a superb job of illustrating many different approaches to ethics, providing examples of practical application of each. this helps the reader develop a critical mind, capable of reasoning his or her way through ethical dilemmas that we all face on a daily basis. pojman is not afraid to go for the jugular on approaches in which he finds serious flaws, such as cultural and ethical relativism. the reader will find that pojman does not adhere to one ethical theory in particular, but rather calls for reason and judgment, based on strong moral principles, in every situation. some situtations call for a utilitarian approach, some for a virtue-ethical approach. whatever approach he takes, however, will be based in thorough and sound reasoning. this book makes its readers want to be better people.
"
589,"this is a great book for a piano student.  it allows them to enjoy true music while learning how to play fairly easy pieces.  these aren't little dittys made up to teach notes.  it is classical music.  beautiful dreamer by stephen foster, traumerei by robert schumann and the happy farmer by robert schumann are my favorite pieces.  they are a joy to learn and play!  this music makes you want to practice. 
i also recommend my first book of christmas carols as well

1104,"when i found ""hour game"" in paperback at our local library's monthly book sale, i thought i had hit pay dirt.  but i cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as ""the winner"" and ""absolute power"" could turn out such a dog.  long, boring, and confusing.  i fear that mr. baldacci hired an ""aspiring young writer"" to ""help"" him crank out a quick book. i cannot pass this book along to my friends -- i couldn't do that to them.  it will be tossed into our blue recycle bin.  what a waste.  what a shame.

221,"zig ziglar has done it again. as an author myself of sales books,  i realize sales is about so much more than just having the 'gift of gab,' and fast talking. it's about asking the right questions and listening to the right answers. it's about not just being a consultant to others, but being a consultant to yourself. it's recognizing you are in the most honorable profession there is. zig's theories exemplify this.

1457,"stephen king has written another attention grabber.  i read, and listened, as i have both the paperback and the audio book.  i found this book great, as it follows both the imaginary and the real sides of life.  i found that as i read the book, i really would like to visit the library that is described in the book.  this book follows down a strange path, emerging in what could almost be explained as a real story of fact in the past.  i recommend this novel, and the audio book as the narrator does a great job, it will not dissapoint as &quot;everything's eventual&quot; did, in my opinion.  good luck and good reading!  (note:  the audio version of this book is narrated by frank muller.  anyone who has listened to stephen king audio books has sure to have been wowwed by frank muller.  in this audio book recording, frank muller's voice is almost unrecognizable and amazing as he plays this roll.  frank muller and audio books are truly like movies for your mind)

971,"alright, for those of you who say rand is criticizing works for false ideals, or lacking in substance, i say this: who is rand to say what the absolute greatest ideals are?  who is rand to say what substance is?  you've got to look at her bias, first.  realize that rand never takes into account anything not related to personal freedom.  as if outside factors never matter; and maybe they don't, for her.  maybe her life in an oppressive russia did nothing to form who she is today.  but i doubt it.

though i believe personal choice plays a huge factor in determining who we are and how we live, outside influences do affect a person.  but she doesn't.  thus she condemns all works that are not driven solely by the individual as crap.  all books that are not driven solely by the individual's sense of reason: don't read, cause it will lessen your iq.  

any work that portrays or is driven by an emotion she doesn't find worthwhile or cannot understand, she condemns.

rand, at least as portrayed in what i've read of her work, is unfeeling toward anything but what she wants.  and this is carried over into this book in what she criticizes.  they cannot hold a little or a fairly large amount of quality, they are either good or worthless.   the pieces of art she says are empty are empty, absolutely.  they don't fit into her paradigm thus have nothing to offer.  nothing to offer her, that is.  

how is a completely selfish person supposed to write a critique of history's best books, telling other people (with different wants and ideas and all the other funtions of an individual) what they should read?  truthfully any criticism in this form, like a list i saw detailing the 100 best literary works in the world, is elitist crap trying to close people's minds toward books that a certain group deems lesser than others.  they have their bias like anyone else.

i say read in variety.  observe art outside of rand's choice of art.  take in all you can, with an open mind, then start pondering whether you agree or not.  if you then agree because you agree, then i say great.  its the basic individualistic response that rand seems to forget to address.  she says question society, but by my line of inquiry.  she says be an individual, but only i know the basis of who you want to be
"
1102,"  for over three years i've been studying buddhism and zen. during that time i've ordered many books within the different buddhist schools. there are many fine authors out there that explain the tenets and fine workings of buddhism as well as zen. i believe a solid background in buddhism background is essential in understanding buddha's message to mankind. however, the true ""nuts and bolts"" of buddhism practice can be found most directly in zen. 
  
it is one thing to know something about a religion or way of life yet it is another to be able to apply it. ezra bayda has most succinctly given the best instruction of how to apply zen to one's life where we need it the most; during those moments when we are gripped with our core pain. core pain is comprised of our anger, traumas, sadness, feelings of inferiority, etc. it is this core pain that can make our life a living hell. ezra examines these emotions and teaches us how we can mindfully learn to transform them in a way that truly works. instead of denying them or trying to escape them we learn that they are part of our path in life. and while it takes courage to be present with these emotions we learn that they are but old programs and often ancient belief systems that take us away from the genuine life we all deserve. 
  
at least one reader has referred to this as being like a self-help book. yet anytime we look for truth whether it be in religion or psychology, aren't we looking for something to help us. ezra offers us the tools to achieve transformation in our life. when i ordered this book i had hoped it would teach me how to truly apply zen teachings to my life. what i didn't realize is that the information this book contains would exceed anything i have read in any religious book, psychology book, or college text. another reviewer said ""where's the zen"" in reference to the contents of this book. ""the zen"" is there on every page. while ezra doesn't use the esoteric style of writing common in zen/buddhist teaching, his simple clearcut way of communication exemplifies the simpleness that zen is truly about. 
  
ezra's other two books ""at home in the muddy water"" and ""saying yes to life"" are excellent as well and deepen your understanding of living mindfully and in the moment. a helpful hint, read his three books in chronological order with this book first. personally, i think that reading them in order adds to a person's understanding and that each book acts like a foundation for the next. ezra bayda i have not had the honor of meeting you personally yet i thank you most sincerely for the gift of your writings. i bow to you for you are a master! there are many of us i'm sure that are looking forward to your future works. 
  
two other excellent zen books that teach mindful living and dealing with difficult emotions are ""beginning mindfulness: learning the way of awareness"" by andrew weiss and ""at hell's gate : a soldier's journey"" by claude anshin thomas. also, the writing's of thich nhat hanh, a great man who highly influenced both of these authors, teaches the art of mindful living in a very understandable manner. good luck to you on the path.
"
1726,"i bought this together with a ""best of"" cd, both containing a lot of songs i really wanted to play on the piano myself. that combination has allowed me to hear what vince played while also reading through the music to see just what it is he played. without exception, i've found the written music exactly true to what vince recorded, including pick up notes, tricky min-maj-min progressions, arpeggios, diminished 9th chords, and what-not, and it has made some previously unapproachable passages much easier to understand. i've also been able to use the book as a sort of learning tool, getting a feel for what a jazz musician really tries to accomplish when he sits down and plays a piece. i would like to have seen some fingering indications included, and without those, i think some beginners will not be able to do much with this work. and personally, i didn't find the performance notations particularly useful (""laid back"" doesn't really convey much to me), but like i said, i also purchased a cd of vince's music, so i already have an idea of what sort of sound i want to achieve. other than those two minor points, i can't find anything wrong with this edition. the binding is ""lay flat"" perfect bound, so the pages stay glued together but pull away from the spine, allowing this book to retain a crisp appearance and feel even after the pages are pulled open on a music stand. guaraldi fans and aspiring jazz pianists will gain a lot from this work
"
864,"this was actually the first kellerman novel i read and i found it kind
of dull at first, but that's only because i didn't know any of the
situations or people among whom i was thrust. after reading a couple
earlier books, i have re-read this one and i now find it interesting.
so, i would really have to recommend that one tries to read the series
more or less in order.

this one starts out with alex delaware seeing a new girlfriend named
allison. robin has married another man after some ten (?) years with
alex. [i haven't read the one where she actually leaves yet (unless this
is the first mention of it), but if she broke his heart ... !] see, i
had no idea who robin was first time i read this - makes a difference.
the cuuuuute little dog named spike makes an appearance too. first time
i read it, he was just an irritating little squirt, but now i know just
how adorable he can really be and it was nice seeing him again.

alex's police pal milo is a lieutenant now and can pick and choose his
cases. he and alex are together when they come across a grisly
crime scene. a young couple has been brutally murdered and the woman can
not even be identified. milo draws alex into the investigation and it
gets complicated. everything seems to lead back to the dead boy's
psychologist and when she turns up murdered too, things really start
cooking with gas!

i adore detective milo sturgis. i know alex is the star, but i can't
help it. milo is such a great character

1791,"if you want to believe an illusion, go for it.  some readers say he is well informed.  whoa.  this guy talks about science without any credentials to do so.

if you are open minded but want truthful facts to make your own opinion, find another source.

387,"tina dirmann did a fantastic job writing about this difficult case, which encompasses motherhood, mental illness, child abuse, and matricide. dirmann does not interject her own biases or agenda into her writing, rather she presents the many different angles of this story in a compassionate fashion. that, in and of itself is impressive, because many writers of true crime tend to lean one side or the other,get caught up in emotion, and appear unable to really present all sides of the story. lessons can be learned from this book regarding mental illness and society's responsibility to help families who are in need of intervention. it is so sad that the extended families of these boys failed not only them, but also tragically failed their mother.
"
1301,"this simply isn't history.  in real life, people do things for reasons.  historians explain what happened and (to some extent) why.  that is how they are able to infer as yet unknown details and even predict future attitudes and acts.  pappe gets plenty of facts wrong, but his biggest failing is to ascribe incorrect or even impossible motives to many of the people of the region.

this book is propaganda masquerading as history. 
"
128,"i'm very disappointed in this book, although some information in it is valuable, it will take a long time to read the entire book cover to cover. it is an excellent textbook but not a handy guide to flip to on a regular  basis and find ideas for what you need. although broken into sections, they  are not readily found or visible. one must search the information needed as  in a research assignment. the reproducibles are mainly for elementary  grades. this was not stated in the very short and brief summary of it's  contents, on-line. although the price was reasonable, i'm not pleased with  the way the book is organized &amp; printed

1372,"'the interface between the written and the oral' is a comprehensive look at the development of writing in general and alphabets in particular, oral poetry in ancient greece and modern africa, oral transmission of (written) vedas, the impact of writing on recently oral cultures in west africa, and the impact of writing on our own abilities of thought and organization. perhaps the most disheartening, but nonetheless informative section, deals with the counterintuitive measures that social scientists have come up with to measure the impact of literacy. they seem to be lacking in common sense. goody, however, is full of common sense, and this book is excellent reading

398,"as a student studying mathematics, i find it very useul! packed with 3200 terms and 200 illustrations, it's a great quick reference guide. i found things in this guide that i couldn't find in any other book or guide. another thing about this reference guide is the lack of poor illustrations and examples. some things this guide helped me with is parabolas, ellipses, hyperbolas, gamma funtion, zeta function, feigenbaum number, the greek alphabet, and much more. i thank david nelson and penguin books for such excellent work

1305,"i just recently discovered an interest in philosophical thought, and i found myself overwhelmed by all the resources available to me.  i had no idea where to start when i stumbled across the philosophy gym.  nothing could have been more appropriate.  it dives right into all the hot topics and gave me some foundational knowledge about how to approach those issues from a logical standpoint.  it introduces the reader to basic philosophical terminology as well as several of the great historical philosophers and their famous arguments.  each topic is brilliantly presented in nice bite-sized chunks with suggestions for further reading at the end of each chapter.  i couldn't be more pleased with this intro to philosophy

1116,"mr. fleishman has written and clear and concise primer on home theater.  clearly, from his years as a staff writer for audio video interiors and other pubs, he has an in-depth knowledge of the ins and out of ht. certainly, everyone who is interested in ht should buy this book and read it from cover to cover.  the best of all is that this volumne is updated on a on-going basis so that its always current with the latest trends and developements from hdmi to dts 96/24.

470,"what should have been a fascinating book, at the very least as a voyeuristic experience, fails to deliver largely due to its poorly written pages. the text stumbles along from incomprehensible link to allusive derailment, making the mistake of huge chunks of repetitive material which inevitably detract from the fascinating subject matter. perhaps more of an editng disaster than an author's failure.....at the heart of which lies a story deserving a more coherent telling
"
674,"i was really looking forward to reading ""ever after"" when i saw the favorable quote on the back cover by  larry gelbart. but the book turned out to be a very cursory glance at the past 25 years of musical theater with remarkably little insight. here are the three things i learned from this book: (1) mega-musicals are almost always artistically corrupt; (2) andrew lloyd webber is the anti-christ; (3) the only innovative musicals to arrive in the past 25 years started off-broadway (mostly at playwrights horizons and lincoln center). most of the hundreds of shows mentioned in this book get one paragraph each, with very few illuminating details. here's what the author says about ""carrie,"" perhaps the most famous recent broadway musical flop: ""carrie, of course, was an instant classic, a monument in the pantheon of failed broadway musicals. adapated by michael gore (music) and don pitchford (lyrics) from the notorious stephen king novel (and even more notorious film), this $7 million musical celebration of prom vengeance and bad taste materialized at the virginia theater on the 12th of may, 1988 and was gone by the 15th, touching all who saw it with a timeless reverence for its indelible, monumental ineptitude."" does that really tell us very much about this musical? did barry singer even see the show? you sure wouldn't know it from this description. and just what, i wonder, makes king's novel ""notorious"" or the movie ""even more notorious""? almost every show in this book rates that brief a mention, but somehow singer finds time for an entire chapter of lloyd webber-bashing where sir andrew invites the author to a cocktail party to show off his newest female singing discovery. the chapter sticks out like a sore thumb, if only because it has nothing to do with the rest of the book, but also because it's one of the few times that singer goes into any detail. aside from a few interesting sondheim quotes, this book is a waste of time.
"
1470,"i really thought i would be able to learn about the philadelphia project from this book, considering the title. however, the actual project doesn't make an appearence until the last chapter. the entire book focuses on ideas that may or may not have contributed to a project that may or may not have taken place. 
this book was disappoiting to an extreme.
"
1523,"i enjoyed the parts regarding the s.s. valiant, but the later part of the book simply didn't work for me. except for picard, who we of course know quite well from the series, the other characters were flat and uninteresting. we never find out what is motivating the alien attackers and they are the cardboard cutout enemy-of-the-week, boring. the whole &quot;adversarial&quot; situation with the 1st officer also just struck me as odd and wrong, and was just not developed correctly or fleshed out beyond being another cardboard enemy for picard

1320,"i have never been a fan of danielle steel's books and have only read a couple in my lifetime, and those many years ago.  i'm not sure what motivated me to pick up toxic bachelors -- extreme boredom? insanity? -- but i slogged through it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad impressions of this writer's work.  actually, i think i was a little surprised by how awesomely bad it was.  the writing was completely repetitive and superficial, and i rather felt that i was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself.  it read like a poor book report:  ""...and then he did this, and then he did this, and after that he did this, and then he laughed.""  we are told that the bachelors -- who struck me as commitment-phobic, a little neurotic, and fairly immature despite their (middle) age, but not necessarily toxic -- are decent, likable guys, but we never really see too much proof of that.  when the ""proof"" does come, it's so ham-handed as to be laughable:  charlie's eyes well up with tears when he meets a young girl who was abused by her mother, and so we know that he truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold complexities to his character.  yeahsurerightwhatever.  most of the story is told through narration, with little bits and pieces of ho-hum dialogue.  the author adopted a third-person point of view, but there's certainly nothing omniscient about it, and the reader is never sucked into the head of one of these characters.  throughout the book they remain about as interesting and dimensional as paper dolls, and their interactions with one another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable.  this is how men behave and relate to one another?  i find that hard to believe, considering that none of the men i know run around telling each other how much they love one another and how important they are to each other.  

i liked the female characters of the book initially.  they all seemed to be strong, capable, independent and emotionally healthy women.  but my opinion of each diminished greatly toward the end of the book, as each woman seemed all too willing to disregard her personal boundaries and put up with extreme schmuckiness from her man.  and the conflicts steel generated amongst the couples seemed ridiculous:  mountains out of molehills.  for instance, gray, the 50-year-old artist who has always been phobic about family, refuses to meet the adult children of the woman he's been with for several months and whom he claims to love.  nevermind the fact that he's known about the adult children since the very beginning.  nevermind the fact that the adult children live in england and italy, while gray and sylvia are new yorkers.  nevermind the fact that they have their own lives and are independent, self-sufficient adults who maintain their relationship with their mother through frequent phone calls and less frequent face-to-face visits.  evidently gray can't see beyond the fact that they are ""kids"" and therefore ""family"" and therefore not to be tolerated.  sorry, but whatever sympathy i'd developed for gray by this point disappeared altogether when confronted by this monstrous display of immaturity.  dump the weenie, sylvia.  you can do better.  the other two guys had similar displays of gross ridiculousness, and of course everything was wrapped up magically, with sudden capitulation, as if the men had just suddenly come to their senses.  

considering what little time and effort was spent on these characters, their conflicts and resolution, i have to wonder why steel even bothered writing this book.  and why i bothered reading i

519,"this is one of nora roberts' best books ever! i have read everything she's written and this is now my all time favorite. i adore this book.  the characters are interesting and very human, the plot is gripping and the background fascinating.  callie, an archeologist, comes to a little town in maryland to set up a dig and ends up learning about her birth parents and reuniting with her ex-husband. what i really like about this is the two main characters already have a history before this book so its so much that they fall in love on the spur of the moment, like most romances (including roberts).  definitely a book i highly recommend for both the romance and the thrilling plot.  it will keep you glued to the pages until you figure out who the bad guys are

13,"lovers of mr. rochester beware - in this, his second book of literary puzzles, john sutherland turns his considerable powers of literary analysis towards, amongst other things, undoing the good reputation enjoyed by jane eyres brooding hero. bronte fans, brace yourself for some idol-smashing. as in his first book of devoted to literary head-scratchers (the wonderful is heathcliff a murderer?), sutherland here sets himself out to answer some of western literatures most intriguing questions. though you might not always agree with some of the conclusions sutherland comes to (we have to have a talk, he and i, about mr. rochesters moral integrity) as a writer he is always witty, as a thinker always innovative, and as a guide through literatures most baffling conundrums, always genial. buy this book and i promise not only will you learn something (and, if youre anything like me, get into some very heated debates with fellow literature lovers about jane eyres prospects for bliss, etc.) - but youll also have a heck of a lot of fun
"
1745,"will somebody please tell me what the appeal is? yes, i know it's a classic. but it's a really, really boring classic. the prequel to charlotte bronte's, jane eyre, is the story of bertha mason's childhood whose literary conceit is to tell us why bertha went nuts. it's also a didactic dinosaur relic of the 1960s that traces the source of her madness to the fact that they didn't like little french girls in jamaica. racism, sexism, and classism drove bertha `round the bend. there. i've saved you the trouble of reading it. now re-read jane eyre instead
"
207,"unfortunately, for all the name brand that this book conveys, i think the cover seems to be the most intriguing part.  there are much better ways for book peddling and the fact that a firm such as mckinsey allowed their name on the title of a book for the sake of a few sales, boggles this readers mind.  the subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull session with all bull and no session.  no actual quantitative analysis is used throughout the book, and if anything more than an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book, i would be astounded.  save some money and go search online for some basic books on beginning valuation.  by the way, those giving 5 stars either can't read english very well or are shills for mckinsey
"
934,"i think that the beginning of the book was the worst part. he started by telling us that he was leaving and wasn't going to tell anyone. he didn't even say goodbye to a lady friend. so he tells us that he's leaving and then he goes back into the past. back when he was a little kid. he tells about different experiances. how he had to stay in bed for almoxt five years. he tells about all the troubles that his family went through. the end was the best part. i usually hate the endings but this one was good.
this bool is meant for older people who like english books. or is it ireland. i think it was set in irelan

420,"not to be disrespectful but are you people for real? i can't believe this book is getting 4 and 5 stars. there was nothing good about this book. a bunch of people in the book did not even matter, bill kendall's wife, the new anchor man pete whatever his last name was, the boss yelena, eliza's boyfriend, the priest, even the soon-to-be-president and his wife, i mean what's the point in even mentioning them? they were not involved in the main events. she didn't even talk about what happened to them at the end. the judge is the only one that matters, and she didn't even write about him all that much. really disappointing. as i said i don't mean to be disrespectful, but to give this book 5stars, you must have read either bedtime stories all your life, or not have read anything.

1406,"i have never been a big fan of motivational books, because they seem so ""pie in the sky"" if you know what i mean. but a friend recommended this one to me and told me it was different. he was right. it was easy to read and in fact i didn't want to put it down. but what i really liked was the ""how to"" part of the book. after all, it's no good reading about other people's success stories if you don't know how to make your own. also, something i thought was interesting is that the author has a website called success compass which helps you set goals and then e-mails you a reminder several times a day. i guess the real key to success is not allowing yourself to forget what you want, and this website doesn't let you forget. hmmmmm . . . electronic nagging as the key to success! ;-) hey, whatever works

1411,"i thought it was me until i read several other reviews of predator.  ms. cornwell can do so much better than this disjointed mess.  if she's going to continue the scarpetta series, she needs to get back on track, creating characters that we care about.  i finished this book as quickly as possible just to get it behind me.  what a disappointment
"
1547,"i have reviewed all 31 chapters of psycho-babble in the book (and the epilogue too).

a very ""nice"" read. indeed entertaining and yes, funny in many ways. they also use doubtfull suggestions -  like bringing ""doughnuts"" because people like them !?

they also ""demystify"" some ""myths"" about teamwork. (i do not know where they got those myths from) - another fragment of their imagination, i suppose.

this ""business"" book is more of a ""romantic novel"" about something relating to ""teams"", full of anecdotal references (very life-like) - but totally unsubstantiated, wanting us to ""believe"" that indeed, ""teams things"" are like they describe it.

from an entertaining point of view - very. from an academic point of view - null. for a business person - if you have time to waist, have fun.

it is interesting to note that they got a uk award for their book. (for entertaining i suppose). i guess this is a way of promoting the book. good marketing technique.

1338,"ever since starting on the simple abundance journey with sarah ban breathnach's first book, i have longed for an opportunity to learn one-on-one from the queen of simplicity and authenticity. we may not be able to meet sarah face-to-face, but now anyone can enjoy a workshop  atmosphere in the comfort of her own home. women caught up in the  day-to-day deluge of deadlines, appointments, and commitments can now curl  up with a pillow and excavate their authentic self. i highly recommend this  book to anyone who wants to savor their life instead of living in a blur

1701,"this is a highly informative and accurate book.  it presents the data in a clear and graphic form, with a minimum of statistical manipulation.  the studies cited by the previous reviewer, lloyd rowsey, are based on econometric modeling.  since the one he mentions, two other econometric models of abortion and homicide have been published with opposite results.  one is by ted joyce, the other by john lott and john whitney.  econometric modeling can prove anything.  if you want to understand crime in america in the 1990s, buy the crime drop

800,"i have an amazon bookmark that advertises ludlum's book ""the sigma protocol"". it says ""in ludlum's latest, an ordinary man battles a global conspiracy."" well gee. that's the plot of this book as well. come to think of it, that's the plot of every book by the man that i've read. a 'vast right wing conspiracy' is set to take over the world. they have small armies, a lot of money and a plan. this time around, a group of military men (naturally) plan to foment terror, and use the chaos to implement their vision of the world (laugh not - millions in the middle east and far left believe 9-11 was something along the same lines). enter ""ordinary man"" joel converse. he's a vietnam vet and p.o,w. who thought he had left that life far behind. it's up to him to save the world. he will survive certain death several times (the bad guys always seem to think they need him alive, and they just have to explain their conspiracy to this total stranger). he will find love, and he'll visit several european cities to boot. of course, a suspension of disbelief is essential for many novels (how else would you believe that a nazi and an israeli are on the same side?), but ludlum's cliched stories are further worsened by the fact that he just couldn't write. his dialogue writing is always tedious, and sometimes just painful to read. action scenes are generic. the only thing he could do right is character background, but that's not enough to save this. ""the aquitaine progression"" might make a half decent tv movie, but to endure 700 pages is just too much

1856,"i love this book--it's beautiful. this book is a delightful romp through the farmyard, with goose leading the way across the pages as she chases a butterfly, causing the ruckus with all the animals. the abstract artwork truly appeals to adults and, therefore, may be too difficult for very young children to comprehend: the pigs in the muck, the kittens in the hayloft, the pigeons in the rafters all might be a little tough for a baby to distinguish. but a parent rereading the book several times in a row will appreciate seeing fleming's gorgeous art each time. my nine-month-old son reacts to the colors with glee and my imitations of the animals with laughter--this is definitely one of his favorites. i highly recommend this book

536,"craig cockran has reprized his first work with a text that is as rich as it is inspiring. detail oriented, yet captivating and simple to read, this book belongs in the library of anyone who is invested in the qi process or just starting a qi program. the writer has once again shown a unique grasp of business and the instructional process. i look forward to the next installment from this outstanding author

953,"i recently read robert monroe's first book, ""journeys out of body"" and found it to be a disappointment - it was just weird. as i noted in my review of that book, i had hoped that the author would discuss his use of sound, for which he is allegedly noted. as i purchased this book at the same time and had nothing else to read, i thought i'd give it a try. 

the book did start out with a brief discussion of some of his ""research"" and i thought that, perhaps, this book might actually have some real substance. that belief; however, quickly disappeared. by the time i had reached the half-way point in the book, nothing remained but a schizophrenic quagmire of incomprehensible gibberish. how does total garbage like this manage to get printed?!

there are those that claim that monroe was a highly left-brained individual who delved into the realm of the creative right-brain. if this book is any indication, one can't help but wonder if monroe was missing his entire left hemisphere! there is nothing logical or, for that matter, even coherent in the babble spewed across the endless pages of this book. it would have been worthwhile if monroe had actually described his experiments and resulting data in a scientific manner. instead, he chose to spew his incoherent ramblings about his own, personal, dream experiences: these wander so aimlessly, from paragraph to paragraph, that one can't help but wonder what real point, if any, he was trying to make.

the really sad thing is that i had really hoped to find a genuinely scientific study of his work - i was actually quite interested in the topic. having now been subjected to two of his useless books, i'm amazed that they're still in print. this is pseudo-science at its absolute worst.

850,"good, but it simply wasn't actionous enough. i don't mind having no action in a book (otherwise how else could i love foundation so much?), but children was a book that needed to have action in it. unfortunately it didn't really. too much philosophical babble that i had to re-read to get it. slightly reminiscent of card's later shadow series with the sheer amount of internal monologue. too much about jane, not enough about the pequeninos and barely anything about ender, which annoyed me. to my shock ender's death did not really impact me in any way, beyond--""huh? wait...ender is dead?"", so little was his role in the book. he probably talked for only about twelve pages altogether.

edit: from now on i am never giving a book that i halfway like two stars again because each time, i receive the urge to change my rating to three stars.  just keep in mind that while it says two, it means three

1938,"i have to give philippa gregory a big thank you! for approaching this story from a different perspective from the other boleyn girl.  it delves into the lives of those in poverty without straying far from the lavish lifestyles of english royalty and wealth.  again i was attached to the characters and their struggles while learning much about the time period and historical events.  there were a few very alluring relationships between the narrator and the men she encounters creating a whirlwind of emotions for the reader but in the end, i was very pleased with the romantic outcome of the book.  so if you are deciding whether or not you'd like to read this after having read the other boleyn girl, i greatly encourage you to do so, you won't regret it

1508,"when john grisham introduced us to bendini, lambert & locke, a memphis tax boutique controlled by the mafia, the idea of an in-house firm for the mob was hilarious. these days no one, least of all our hero scott finn, is particularly sure that organized crime doesn't just control the firm, but also the governor's office, the us attorneys office and the boston pd.

finn, who worked and fought his way out of the streets of southie to the thick-pile carpets of boston's brahmin legal establishment, finds himself back among the thugs and characters of the world he thought he left behind.  when a fellow associate and friend with benefits is killed by a copycat killer seeking to emulate ""little jack"" who was terrorizing the city finn is drawn into the fray, where he acquits himself brilliantly while maintaining his place on the partnership track.

finn even finds a new love interest in the cop who is trying, though not very hard, to put him away. and a childhood friend proves an invaluable ally as finn attempts to clear himself and clean up the city in the process.

if it seems over the top, it is. but it is good fun too

704,"the cover of this book compares it to the kite runner, so it caught my attention.  i honestly could not stop reading as ""yasmina khadra"" does an amazing job of making believable and likeable characters.  he weaves a tale of how terrible situations eat away at people's humanity.

my only nit is the ending was a bit predictable.  that said, it was still a very good ending that rings true.  spoiler:  if you wonder why she didn't come back, consider that she would not forget the face of the man that bumped into her on the street, which led to them being stopped, which ultimately resulted in her husband's death.

i honestly can't wait to read more by ""yasmina khadra""

367,"did you ever know someone whose life was just ""perfect"" ?? someone who went to college, got married at age 23, found a great job with valuable stock options... someone who settled down in a house in a nice city at age 25 or 26, started a family a year or two later, and who now seems to ""have it all"" ?? well, after world war ii, this happened to just about everyone in the silent generation, and it happen to most in the boomer generation, and it's happening to just about no one in generation x. this books speaks to members of generation x and describes the suffering and coping mechanisms for these people.

this book, now 15 years, is about a generation that was sold down the river by its elders - generation x. the book describes 3 young people, andy, dag, and claire, who visit palm springs and tell stories of their lives and of their friends who are suffering in life. the author douglas coupland is actually telling stories from vancouver british columbia, one of the first cities in north america to be sold out to foreign economic colonizers from hong kong (who escaped to vancouver to avoid the 1997 mainland takeover.) in this city, the worst 1100 square foot fixer-upper house costs a third of a million dollars, or 10 years of take-home pay for a mid-career household.  economic success is impossible in the physical confines of the city - the system is rigged against everyone except rich immigrants and the existing upper class of blue-collar boomers who purchased homes in the  1970's and 1980's. many aspects of the book (such as ""reverse sabbatical"", ""mcjobs"", etc.) reflect the severe economic conditions faced by high-achieving intellectuals who go nowhere economically in that city.

in my grandparents generation, all you had to do was to go to college. in my parent's generation, you needed to go to college and become a successful professional. in my own generation, you need to co-found a startup company and be among the 10% of founders who can sell off the company or have an ipo. do you notice something here? yes, it's getting more and more difficult to be marginally successful in america.

because gen x'ers find that traditional paths to success - hard work, taking chances, saving and investing - don't work any more, they resolve to live like their parents by either living with their parents or by borrowing money endlessly and hoping for a miracle. fiscal irresponsibility is at an all-time high, and has squandered everyone's future! 

in this environment of perpetual economic slavery, coupland counsels generation x'ers to break free of the traditional career models that have been rigged by their elders for failure. coupland counsels us all to re-examine what is success in our life and how to achieve it.   this book is a call to enlist in a class warfare between gen-x'ers and their elders!  in many ways, this book is similar to ""the razor's edge"" by w. somerset maughen or ""the monk and the riddle: the art of creating a life while making a living"", in other words, redefine your notion of success in the world, while waiting for our evil society to implode in upon itself, which must surely happen in the near future ..
"
494,"i recently finished reading this book. this is really a great book and gave me some insight into my own behaviour. it would be fair to say that this book has great value to those who get through first 3 chapters and understand the theory behind rest of the book.

some reviewers have written about the validity of the theory iteself. while i am not qualified to comment  on these reviews, one thing i can definitely conclude is that this book provides a solid base to those who are trying to understand their own behaviour and trying to achieve improvements in it. a theory, that too developed quarter century ago, can not be expected to stand 100% vindicated today. the more importent question is what use you are trying to put it to. so may be for a psyciatrist this is not a great book but for a layman like myself this book explains most of the things. after reading this book i could find out why i behave the way i behave mostof the times. to a certain extent i learnt to control my responses. also i have a feeling that the claims made by dr. harris might be quite right in 1972 in light of the knowledge, then prevalent. 

second objection seems to be dividing 5 or 6 billion population in 4 types of people. i think this conclusion is far from correct. dr. harris has repeated said that most of the people belong to ""i am not ok and you are ok"" category. out of the remaining 3 cattttegories 2 are shared by people who have not had proper childhood and the fourth is achieved by enlightenment of an individual. the objective here is not to merely categorize, but to show that how most of us have the common position ""i am not ok and you are ok"". now this should not be taken as a gross simplification of human nature, but as a fundamental problem in human psycology that prevents one from producing rational responses. 

third critisism on this book stems from the fact dr. harris seems to quote philosophers with whom he does not agree 100%. it seems ludicrous to suggest that one must agree 100% with somebody else to merely quote a subsection which both of them agree upon. i don't think dr. harris wrote this book to declare to the world that he belongs to or believes in a certain academic thought 100%. the books surely derives from various thoughts put forward by various intellectuals (with whom he does not agree 100%) for the benefit of the reader. to call this approach pretentious is pretentious iteself.

i feel that reader should not by biased by comments made by reviewers. read this book with an open mind. read the chapeters on pac and marriage, pac and children, pac and social implications, pac and moral values. in this world that is becoming more and more crooked every other day, it tries to teach something good (and this good is not subjective or relative but absolute). thanks

1568,"i originally had to read this book for a history of rock and roll class at the university of cincinatti. i found the subject interesting, and the professor gave wonderful lectures. i had good expectations about this book going in, but those quickly soured as i read it.

it seems correct, at least, about the social problems of the different eras and their relation to rock. not that such is a particularly daunting feet.

however, it is rife with laughable fallacies. for instance, it calls david bowie, amongst other glam rock bands of the era, metal. it futher goes on to call many pop bands of the 60s and 70s rock, when they have no guitar work and no bass line at all, such as the carpenters.

i really had a good laugh when they called bad religion hardcore. bad religion is about as hardcore as elvis is rap. further massive genre confusion consisted throughout the entire book.

i also noted several drastic misinterpretations of songs. for instance, it claims 'thunder rolls' by garth brooks is about domestic violence. its about infedility, not focusing on violence at all, but rather the emotional ramificationsof being cheated on.

the writing is also rather dry. many times it is merely a citing of the names of band members as well as constantly describing minor changes in bands lineups which are of no true consequence. it also tends to list off songs which have no impact on any giving band's successes or failures.

after reading the book in completetion, i really had to question the earlier passages about older rock and blues (50s to 60s) that i had thought were true. in the end, i felt that it wasted my time and money and possibly misinformed me more than anything

576,"the amount of violence in this book is excessive over relatively insignificant motives.  i had a hard time believing all this was happening in 1948.  i am not questioning mosley's portrayal of racism.  however, i did a little research into just how violent place los angeles was in 1948, and the answer is not very.  there may have been poverty, racism, alcholism, but l.a. county seemed pretty safe; the late 1940s had some of the lowest homicide rates since as far back as one researcher was able to find, 1827!  mosley may have been more familiar with l.a. of the 1970s and 1980s and just assumed that it had always been that way.  throw in speakeasies, gangsters hijacking liquor trucks, and one gets the impression that mosley is confusing the 1948 with 1928.

i am not so pedantic as to insist that fiction be historically accurate.  but many, many people hail mosley for depicting a dark side of life/era/place that had not been shown before.  from what i can tell, he has simply combined stereotypes from the 1920s and 1970s (i guess those years average to be about 1948).  mosley is depicting a fantasy world of his own creation.  however, i doubt he ever tried to pass it off as authentic, and i hope readers realize that it is not.

easy rawlins in this novel falls into the rather weak, but unfortunately large, group of fictional detectives that actually accomplish little detecting.  a detective actually solves a mystery using his own intellect; that is interesting to read.  detectives in less skilled hands solve mysteries via  confession.  easy does solve one of the murders on his own, but just about everything he ""solves"" is simply confessed to him.  i find that extremely dissatisfying.

mosley has packed the book with violence, but seems to know very little about violence himself.  none of the fights are well described.  easy, for being a self-professed ""killing machine"" can't actually fight worth a damn and is surrounded by guns but does not apparently know anything about them.  they are either big or they are small.  he does not come of as being hard-boiled, but rather a pathetic braggart

mosley does show signs of being a very good writer.  but i think he is too far over his head in this genre to come up with something exceptional.  i imagine that his work must have improved, but this effort is nothing to get exceited over.  and again, i don't obsess over accuracy, but a little bit of research would have gone a long way in firming the foundation of this novel.
"
369,"thirty years later and this classic remains a compelling read. this book has fueled a thousand others, setting the perspective for all those interested in the building blocks of life. it's a genes-eye-view of where we came from and how we are motivated, a science and reason-based treatise that is compulsory reading for those of us intent on learning from and about our remarkable natural history. other books by dr. dawkins maybe an easier read but this is where it all started
"
1146,"don't get me wrong, i really enjoy neal stephenson's books.  the historical content he winds into his plots is engaging.  however, i have been working with the micro computer since before the command line.  neal, you have the title wrong.  in the beginning was the monitor.  no doubts in my mind.  my right hand is still trained to enter octal codes on a keypad at lightening speed!  the command line came much later, more like the coalescence of matter in the universe when clumps of useful things needed some impactful gravity.  the monitor was there before the clumps and after the octal toggle switches, address load and register load momentary switches.  the monitor got the human fingers attached to the computer once and for all.   so, 2 stars because the title is just wrong
"
1078,"some photographers think what's erotic is what's hidden and left to the imagination. two thirds of the pictures in this book are fig leafed with shadows or clothing, leaving plenty to the imagination. think of playboy magazine in the 1950's or vogue or madamoselle magazine today.  many of these are stylistic, but not very erotic.  one in three of the photos in the book are erotic, not afraid of nudity. don't make the investment in this book if you want high level eroticism. instead get ""shaven angels"", ""natural beauties"", ""100 naked girls"", or ""crazy,sexy girls"". 
"
1816,"i am reading this for a college course called ""history of the american city"". this book is a typical 'college texbook' in that it is filled with numbers, dates, percentages, figures, numbers, oh did i say numbers, dates, figures, and years, oh and plenty of numbers... the brilliant,dilligent,honored, and esteemed scolar of a  woman that wrote it sure knows her numbers, facts, years, etc... i, on the other hand, am absolutley hating it and foolishly i have allowed the drop date to pass, so i have to read the book or fail the class. i am getting nothing from the book regarding any kind of understanding of any of these cities , unless i am willing to spend years interpreting the multitude of data the book heaps upon me. needless to say, from (attempting)reading it i am getting a headache and don't really even have the time to write this review. i say that if even one person is deterred from reading this expose' of numbers, names, dates, figures, facts, percentages, orders, years, dates and more numbers, dates, facts, figures (are you getting my drift yet?), it will be time well served though.--- avoid--- this--- book.
    please -- find another book. maybe if people told the truth about this brand of writing,more professors might have to teach and people like ms. abu-lughod wouldn't continue to  make money off of writing books such as this, and folks like her might have to write to communicate!!!!, like the rest of us.thank you for taking the time to read this.
  ok, i have to say it: this sucks.

 
"
770,"i felt that the book was basically the same as the previous edition, with the exception of aromatherapy, and electric filing.  unfortionatly no one book can give all of the information that is required about a subject.  that is what teaching is all about.  i generally supplement the material from other books, and florida law so our students stay on the right path.  over all i would have to say that this book was above average, and addressed many of the changes in the industry to date
"
1637,"after reading the trilogy, i was left wondering what the hell happened? i have just read all 3 of the his dark materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker.
   pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story - one of the most creative stories i've come across in 20 years of reading fantasy. there isn't even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess. if you look up `anticlimax' in the dictionary, you'll see a picture of this book. from first page to last, time is wasted on boring characters, while all the good ones are either killed off, or just mia for the entire book. spoilers ahead.
  what about lyra and her parents? somehow, she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl? she never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations. and will just goes back with mary malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops. over a cup of tea, naturally. and that's it for him.
in addition to all that, this book doesn't even seem to be connected to the first two. none of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends, will and lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 . . .  all in the last 30 pages. what happened to the story, for cripes sake?!  and what happened to the `temptation'? was choosing not to stay with will her way of not succumbing to it? the whole premise is just so lame to start out with. as an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries didn't endanger the universe, why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give lyra and will a chance to know each other. the flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another. supposedly, they had more than gonads going for them, they survived death together!
  pullman didn't feel like thinking it through, he just wanted a gut wrenching ending. in addition to that, he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the `reality' of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning. all of will and lyra's efforts are futile, kind of like - guess what? religion for the rest of us morons. 

after having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa-elephant aliens or whatever, ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper. iorek byrnison, lee scoresby - instead we get page after page about mary malone the disaffected former nun. pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in him or anything for that matter!
  this is not children's literature, it's a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess. it's totally dishonest to sell this as a children's book, or even as a competent work of fiction. all of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one.
 
we never get closure on lyra's parents.
we never really understand what dust is and where it comes from.
we never see will reunited with his mother.
we get a lame battle where `god' dies and no one even knows why or how.
lyra and will fall in love, but have to `sacrifice' it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever, with only flimsy reasoning behind it.
the mulefa and mary malone's work together amounts to nothing, everyone just goes home. presumably, will goes home, although we never see it. all that yearning after his mother and so forth . . .nothing.
the major enemies are killed off too easily - and what about armageddon? what happened to the fortress and all the rebel angels and . . .you get the idea. it all just sort of disovles.
mary forgot to be the serpent, or else i missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa.

another reader pointed out:
"" phillip pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series. instead, the story falls flat under the weight of the author's own agendas and mockeries. what a waste of time. i can't believe this book actually won awards. it stopped being thought-provoking and started being inane and silly.""

 it would have been better if lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream. instead, relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the kingdom of heaven in the course of her lifetime. absurd.
this was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life.
"
1418,"this is an essential read for anyone who wants a deeper understand of american foreign policy. a year after this book was published, there were over a hundred reviews. regardless of whiether one disagrees or agrees with the author, finds the author right or wrong, interesting or boring, this book is one of the most influential books, if not the most influential book that affected american foreign policy. in fact, the current bush adminstration's policies, george kenan's containment, henry kissinger's policies as well as countless adminstration's policies are shaped or affected by this book. my area of study is the foreign policy of post world war two american governments, and never have i understood it with greater clarity after i read this book. it is the thread which runs through the policies of all the administrations, differing on extent. (i studied the policies first and read the book the year after). it is a fascinating book and hard to put down. the author writes in a european style (beautiful long sentences,etc.), which in my opinion makes it more eloquent and in the opinion of my co-students makes it more difficut to read. he tries to give a balanced perspective from which one can think critically. ms. rice and mr. kissinger were heavily influenced by this book. to understand them, this is a must read. in and of itself, it is an excellent book, a classic, and thousands others significantly more qualified than i have reviewed it. look even at other reviews on this website or at well known journals for a more accurate assement of the book itself by political scientists
"
93,"i try to read items that i would not necessarily agree with. however, this piece of doggerel is nothing but exagerrations, misquotes, and spin. she uses tacky research to make points that don't exist, then brushes off any critique as ""liberal bias"". if you are a conservative, please read something that will allow us to discuss matters. coulters' book should be titled ""slander: liberal lies i made up.
"
1031,"this author has written ""kitchen table wisdom"" which was recommended to me a year ago by my doctor..ms remen remembers her zayde who died whe she was 7 and tells us all the wonderful things he taught her...she is a physician and therapist and combines the lessons she learned at age 7 with her professional knowledge..i love this book and find myself returning to it time and time again to re-read the stories of strength, refuge and belonging..this book is much more than ""chicken soup""...it is ""chicken soup with matzo balls
"
667,"a gold sticker on this book's cover reads &quot;winner of the nobel prize for literature.&quot;  don't be mislead. the sticker must refer to the author not the book.  while he no doubt received the prize, after wading through the work i can't believe it was for this piece of work.  i found the book exceedingly boring, a chore to read every step of the way.  as the iberian peninsula physically separates from europe, several unengaging and underdeveloped characters (the most interesting of which was a dog) wander from one destination to another with meager purposes, certainly none i cared about. while the book may have been intended as an allegory for portugal's relationship with the rest of europe and the european union, it failed to strike a chord.  i'll chalk this book up as something only a pulitzer prize judge would love
"
1903,"do you like romance novels? do you call your dogs your babies? this is the book for you. the thriller aspect of this book is far overshadowed by the romance portion, and the annoyingly repetitious mentioning of the dog could possibly drive most readers over the edge. this was my first johansen novel, and it most certainly will be my last. two stars for actually wrapping up the story without leaving too many loose ends. 
"
1220,"cruel, horrible story with a typical barr convoluted plot. the abuse of children, evil ranger poising as a dead ranger, freaky religious sect, dead animals on the bed, and lost children were all too disturbing and disgusting to me. i've read many barr books, and my biggest complaint up until now has been that sometimes there are so many characters, it's hard to keep them straight. in this book, that was the last of my worries. i didn't even finish it, i was so turned off
"
1096,"less a view from afar or broad exposure of solitude from the human condition, this book more aptly excerpts the author's personal conflicts with human relationships.....a one-on-one wrestling match with the self with no spectators and no judges. the book is a good read for academic analysis, but not so fun for venturist philosophy
"
1665,"practical, sage advice from stanley. not as good as his follow up, ""the millionaire mind"" this book is somewhat pedantic. it also suffers from the fact it's extremely dry. the author's writing is much more engaging in his followup, and that's a much faster read. 

 in addition to offering some practical tips ""the millionaire next door"" also lends itself to parody in books like dave barry's money secrets, a book called ""maybe life's just not that into you"" and something from andy borowitz, the name of which escapes me. 

if you have to choose between ""the millionaire next door"" and ""the millionaire mind"" go with the latter. 
"
1421,"terry's son, nile, has honored his father (and done the rest of us a huge favor) by publishing this collection of the best of terry's shorter works.

terry concluded at one point that film had surpassed literature as the communication medium of choice, and devoted most of the rest of his life to that arena. his interview ""on screenwriting"" describes both the benefits and the frustrations associated with that choice. his advice is just as relevant to the would-be screenwriter today as it was when he wrote it.

his ""proposed scene for kubrick's rhapsody,"" and ""plums and prunes,"" provide interesting examples of proposed movie scenes that will prove interesting to readers unfamiliar with that arcane art.

as other reviewers have noted, ""grooving in chi"" is an excellent description of the chicago riots during the democratic national convention in 1968.

finally, pieces like ""the beautiful-ugly art of lotte lenya,"" ""when film gets good,"" ""rolling over our nerve-endings [william burroughs],"" and ""writers at work [henry green]"" prove that he could write serious criticism.

through it all flows that wonderful, irreverent, sense of humor.

good stuff
"
361,"when yours truly was eleven and in reading class, ""incident"" was required reading.  this had to be the most ridiculous book that i ever had the displeasure of reading. i mean, the boy is cared for by a badger!  badgers are mean and ornery critters that don't much like people or even their own kind.  i did not believe it at eleven, nor do i now.
also, eckert certainly didn't need to include some of those descriptions.  was it really necessary to describe a mother badger eating her offspring's excrement?  what eleven-year-old wants to read about that?
so, for kids who like to read long descriptive passages about things they really didn't want to know about in the first place: this book's for you

271,"one of the nicest things someone did for me when i lost my husband to leukemia was to send me this book.  the selections are sympathetic and inspiring.  also, they're short at a time when the mourner really can't concentrate on long selections.  this book has helped me through the most difficult time of my life
"
1061,"every once in a while i like to pick up a book that is outside the realm of usual reading, and look for a surprise, or spark to keep the fires of imagination from dying out - it is with this mindset i picked up ""wouldn't take nothing for my journey now.""  and what did i find as a result of my maverick literary exploration?  ehh...

ms. angelou may not take anything for her journey, but based on the cover price she will take $17.00 to tell you a bit about it, and even this may not even seem like that bad a deal were it not for the fact that either her journey was bland, her insights wanting or her conclusions misguided - whatever the cause, this book is dreadful.  if you are looking for the usual meaningless new age spiritual gobble-gook; i.e., about boundaries, respect, finding ones direction, learning what it means to be a women, etc. then this journey is for you - but if you see this nonsense as the nonsense it is, you will be best served my buckling up your shoes and journeying elsewhere
"
382,"camenson definitely has experience in this career with many &quot;career books&quot; to her credit.  however, there are better books out there on writing with more information. this book follows the same old tired format that vgm books are 'not so' famous for.  the internet has more info for a lot less money

402,"i did not find this book very helpful when it came to identification. it did help with classification and mapping
"
1728,"this book opens our eyes. sure, we feel that we know what we should be doing. many times we are right in our hunches. yet, we still do not always do what needs to be done. instead, out of either laziness or taking the easy road, we fail because it is so easy to do so. besides, the customer will always walk in the door. right? as this book reminds us, the customer may never be back. it is in the insight of a professioanl like tasca that we are reminded of wehat we may already know. again, our implementation of these rules which he explains simply, we will achieve. another book i encourage is ""cars and people: how to put the two together.""
"
1148,"this book is one of the best on understanding dogs and also for training them. our daughter dr. shannon dominguez dch who is head of the maui animal therapy program --- highly recommends this book. [...] she has trained therapy dogs in a short time using these methods.   we have adopted two little terriers from shelter and they are respondeing beautifully to the day by day suggestions on how to train young as well as old dogs and we would say these methods would work on children :- ) as well!!
"
782,"was given this book as a freebie--someone must be buying up copies.  for an austinite, this adoring account of the life of a hasbeen fifth-string techno-celebrity is a little embarrassing in its breathlessness--kind of reminds one of the courtiers who saluted when louis the xiv's chamber pot was carried by, except this isn't the sun king, guys.  get a life, or at least an authentic artist to swoon over--all of garriott's stuff was strictly derivative.  now that we have the real lord of the rings to watch, who cares about cheap imitations
"
1279," this book doesn't even deserve a star. i just fell upon it, on a bookshelf with loads of old books in my house. i'm nearly 17 years old, and perhaps this book is the kind that you appreciate as you get older, but honestly, i don't see myself enjoying this book even in 20 years... i've read so many reviews raving about how 'poetic, sensual, wonderful' it is and what a talent the person is...sorry i don't see it!

anyone can write a bunch of sex stories. i didn't see anything poetic in the writing...it was plain. as for sensual and arousing? hardly. it was crude, and vulgar. it was sex, sex, sex... and presented harshly, with none of the sensuality, the sweetness, the gentle pleasure one likes to associate with sex... it was boring, repetitive, and i'll admit disturbing.

what was the point of the story where the hungarian whatever forced himself on his adolescent children? or the raped little boy? it was just weird. there's just the sex, and no development of any points she may be trying to make. it's kind of just left there...unfinished... unsatisfying. frankly, it was so distasteful (vulgar), i was shocked. and i'm not religious, puritan, conservative or any such thing...quite the opposite, i have an open mind. but this book left me cold
"
1488,"i read the good doctor's book eat to live and then bought china study which he talks a lot about in this book.  then i bought this book being curious after reading a few other books on fasting and this book wins hands down though i do feel he's being overly cautious about doing long fasts of more than 5 days without medical supervision to protect himself as people have been doing long fasts for centuries without medical supervision and doing just fine and since finding a doctor in even a large community is rare indeed one is left to do this on their own.  

being a vegetarian for more than 37 years i became an almost 100% vegan after reading eat to live and have to say that i feel great with more energy and even started reducing anti-depression med i've been taking for severe depression.  yesterday i took my last pill! all week i've been emptying  my refrigerator in order to start my water fast tomorow.  and reducing my one cup  of coffee in the norning to none because i remember clerly that awful caffiene withdrawl healache, i'm going to do 10 days and hoping for 14.  i've done 3 day fast before and one 5 day and that was great.  

yes, there are some flaws in both books and i wish the good doctor would have made use of a good editor as it's not as professionally written as it could be and the recipes in eat to live are atrocious with too much canned foods and not healthy organic foods but i'll forgive him because he got me on the china study which changed my life and his studies and own experience helping people get well are good and inspiring.

why am i going on a 10 day detox water diet?  i read randall fitxgerald's one hundred year lie and that was the catalyst that pulled it all together for me. a detox fast absolutely necessary after my years on earth and after too many years on anti-depressants

i'm keeping dr. fuhrman's fasting book close by during the next 10 hopefully 14 days for support and encouragement.  

i did make the mistake of telling my coworkers that i was starting a 10 day fast though the good doctor warned me not to.  the comments from them were typical i suppose knowing their health or lack of but i held my tongue.  those comments are just like the stupid ones some of the reviewers of dr. fuhnman's books make along with other nutrituion books. but i thinkof the wisest words,"" you are responsible for your own health"" and think about my not being able to remember the last time i had a cold and the last flu i had in 1964 and smile.  

i don't intend to support the ill-begotten medical-pharmecutical industry.

the last time i went to the dr. i promptly firedhim after his continued to badger me into getting manograms. and other tests,   i repeated that i eat well etc and he said nutrition had nothing to to do with breast cancer and i just walked out of his office forever. i'd rather read a book
"
1454,"while this book, like its predecessor, is beautifully illustrated and a joy to read, it is the presentation of quiltmaking as a shared experience among family and friends that make both these books so special.  i loved the first so much, i had to have this one the moment it appeared and it has only served to add to my list of pending projects
"
2,"the four tales in this collection are beautifully composed; they are art, not just stories.  each story is deep in its unique complexities.  each one has plots and subplots and paints an impeccable image of the story upon the reader's mind.  and when i look back upon the book as a whole, upon the adventurous stories, the excitement and emotion that the author presents so exquisitely, i can't help but be extremely impressed.
"
522,"this book contains the childhood memoirs of peter reich.  as the son of psychoanalyst wilhelm reich, peter led a bizarre life.  he lived with his parents on the family estate of orgonon in the backwoods of maine.  not only did his father develop a unique form of psychotherapy, but he also was a theorist who experimented with unknown forms of energy.  as wilhelm's only child, peter was one of the first recipients of reich's therapy methods, which involved special forms of touch, energy channeling, ""softening the stomach"", and inducing vomiting (in peter's account). peter was also made lieutenant in his father's defensive squad that protected the earth from ufo attacks through the use of ""accumulator guns"".  the elder reich eventually got in trouble with the fda for manufacturing and promoting medical equipment without proper testing for safety and effectiveness.  the court case involving his work eventually landed him in jail through contempt of court.  not long after being sent to prison, he passed away, apparently of heart failure.  upon his father's death, peter found himself at the tender age of 13 forced to confront his father's legacy of brilliance and madness.  up until the time of his father's death, he had believed everything his father told him, not knowing enough of contemporary scientific theories to understand how different his father's version of reality was from most other people's, nor having established an identity of his own through which he could objectively choose between his father's explanations and standard scientific approaches.  in this book, peter tries to sort out for himself what is real and what is not, what is his, and what is his father's.

the book reads like the proverbial onion-chapters move in a dreamlike fashion from one period of time to another.  sometimes it's hard to tell if what peter is describing actually took place, or whether it was all an imaginative game in his head.  by the end of the book, the reader will have some inkling of the confusion in peter's mind, but, like peter, may not be capable of saying what really happened.  in any case, this is very much a book about peter reich, and not wilhelm reich, although readers who want to learn more about wilhelm reich may find some clues to his ideas through the interpretation of his son, who experienced them first hand and without question
"
40,"man, oh man, i think this is one of the worst books i've ever read.  if i could give the thanatos syndrome negative stars, i would!

seriously, half way through, i came to amazon to see how bad other people thought it was.  boy was i shocked to see that almost all of these reviews were positive!

i found the book bizarre, unfocused and poorly written.  the volcabulary repeatedly seems misused.  the plot is not reasonable given the safeguards that us funding agencies have in place with regards to human experimentation.  the physics, engineering, psychology, medical chemistry and biology are uninformed and unrealistic.  characters are introduced as though they will be important to the outcome, only to have them dissipate.  and so on.

the characters don't even seem like real people.  for example, the main character recognizes his cousin by seeing her ankles - and only her ankles - flashing below a curtain, and yet he is apparently unaware of what degree of cousins they are.  how could someone know a person that well, but still only have a vague idea of how they were related by blood?  or:  one of the more reliable male characters blows duck hunting calls at women he finds attractive - as though he really thinks this will attract them.  c'mon, if the guys a nut (and anyone who tries to seduce women by talking 'duck' to them is nuts!), write him as a nut the whole way through, don't make him the cornerstone of reliability at the book's climax!

the book's title isn't even explained, for crying out loud.  thanatos means death in greek, i believe, but i could never understand what the author/editors/audience thought was dying.

i won't read this one again, nor will i look for anything else by percy walker. 
"
1963,"this book expounds endlessly on how best to limit the impact of people on the backcountry in the very best traditions of the sierra club.  it's more of a philosophy book than a &quot;how to&quot; book.  if anyone wants to  learn how to backpack and/or camp, he would be better advised to buy the  several books by karen berger and chris townsend, in particular the  backpackers handbook
"
1119,"zadie smith is one of the most powerful authors i have read in recent times. she is so subtle about the race factor that we don't get to find out the races of the protagonists till the first 50 pages or so. she has also captured the emotions of kiki and zora perfectly (why is it that women always stand out in emotional moments!) and the characters stay with you even after you put the book down.

if you enjoyed the movie ""crash"", you will love this one
"
225,"i enjoyed this book for the most part. i feel the trip throught the stargate could have been better developed but it was enjoyable to see an inside view of the workings of the &quot;mountain&quot;. the main characters were all there, participating in the problem solving.  there was a writers view of the teamwork seen in each episode, and some food for thought added in as well. is the world really ready for the idea that we are part of a bigger universe out there? i don't know but this book presents some interesting questions. i await the next book in the series
"
650,"this book doesn't make any sense. it is so, so, so b-o-r-i-n-g. the book is not well written, and the sentences are way too short. i woudn't recommand this book to anyone
"
848,"the author of this book, warren wagar, is apparently a professor of ""future studies."" i certainly hope he has long been fired from that post. ""a short history of the future"" was  written in 1989, but the writer is so ignorant of politics, and so wrong, to be blunt, it reads as if it was written in the 1940's. orwell's 1984 is more on the mark than this. 

he shows barely any creativity in his ""predictions"" and clearly was barely even aware of much of the contemporary political developments of his time. the fact that he assumes the soviet union will continue plodding along well into the 21st century is incredibly naive. the fact that he assumes the nation's socialist economy system would survive equally long is similarly bizarre. did he read the newspapers? did he pay any attention to that gorbachev fellow and the path he was bringing russia down? 

and honestly, did anyone really expect that germany would remain divided into two states until time immortal?  or that latin america and africa would remain dictatorships forever? or that black rule in south africa would not occur until 2014?

if this book had been written 30 or 40 ago, it would be excusable. this book is just sloppy. he doesn't even do a good job describing how his corporations take over the world. everything is just described in these overly flowery sweeping generalizations. like ""and then the capital lords seized control of the governments and made the state wither like an autumn rose."" that sort of thing. 

the author is clearly an ""ivory tower"" academic who believes history can be predicted sorely through dry marxist theory and analyzing dubious vague ""trends."" the fact that this book became horribly dated something like three years after it was published is quite a strong indictment of a man whose entire job was devoted to predicting the future.

1839,"the greatest paragraph in all of singer is the one at the beginning of his story, shosha, where he says he knew two dead languages, hebrew and aramaic, and was educated to read about the cultic requirements of a temple which had not existed for 1900 years; he knew yiddish which he considered perhaps not a language at all, and that although his ancestors had lived in poland for five or six hundred years he knew only a few words of polish, although he lived in poland for all of his youth until he came to america.

805,"this book of eight stories by virginia woolf shows virginia's mind at work demonstrating her &quot;stream of consciousness.&quot; each story flows from one thought to another asking different questions about life.  for  example, &quot;the mark on the wall&quot; questions the meaning of life and  existence.  &quot;an unwritten novel&quot; is about what people hide and  what you don't know about a person you seat next to on an  &quot;omnibus.&quot;  all these stories will make you look at life in a  slightly different way

1516,"i like evanovich novels for a light read and a few laughs, and usually her hero and heroine are downright combustible - the stephanie plum and joe morelli relationship, sustained through 12 books so far, being a case in point. but full scoop was actually a trial to get through. i could hear another voice in there which was distracting and interrupted evanovich's comedic rhythm. the whole tone of the writing was down about five notches from what i have come to expect from evanovich. the silly villains were either being too goofy or too violent, leaving us wondering were we supposed to be amused or frightened? the least forgivable of the sins committed in full scoop was the fact that there was absolutely no chemistry between maggie and zack. none at all. so it's hard to label the book: a sort of but not really romance, an almost but not much of a woman-in-danger.... maybe a new genre altogether - the slapstick thriller
"
1840,"i wonder how long it will be before frost's literary stock is devalued as much as it deserves to be. these are trite and banal poems that do not ring true or sincere. frost seems distant from both his poems and the reader. what he has to say is obvious and unoriginal. how he says it is on the level of a hallmark greeting card at its best; at its worst, it is no better than a limerick. posthumous revelations about his horrific cruelty to others and his shrewd creation/manipulation of his celebrity image as the new england farmer-poet only confirm that there was something seriously wrong with this man and his poems that an earlier generation missed. how earlier generations could find genius in such obvious observations is astounding.
bad poetry from a twisted man

330,"never in my life have i been so outraged by what i have read as by the drivel spouted by dr. west in this book (in his translator's note), and by the use of `unponderingly' and ""the thinkery"" (among other things) in his translation of the clouds. i also read his translation of plato's apology of socrates, and found it grossly inferior to jowett.

four texts on socrates is not a book to be tossed aside lightly: it should be hurled with great force. (apologies to dorothy parker.)

not only are the translations themselves inexcusably inept, almost everything that he writes in his translator's note is wrong.

the clouds is a play, not a scientific or mathematical treatise. as such, it has characters and dialogue. a `modern' translation of a play must be something that could be presented on a stage and make sense to a `modern' audience. if a character is supposed to be bizarre or out of the ordinary, one does not make him spout drivel such as 'unponderingly'; one gives him a `shtick', which is a theatrical term. it's more or less a running gag associated with a particular character. you create, through clever ways of speaking or odd ways of stringing his words together, a characterization. he could be made to speak like a parody of william f. buckley or the star wars character yoda. as it stands, west's text cannot be presented as a play.

it is neither necessary nor useful to coin such nonsense as 'unponderingly'; indeed, it is inexcusable. it conveys neither humor nor cleverness. it comes off simply as stupid. the translator of a play must know something about theatre and drawing characters, which dr. west obviously does not. to state it bluntly: the translation of plays should be left to people who understand theatre and characterization, and who are creative. dr. west doesn't have a creative bone in his body.

in regard to his translation of plato's the apology of socrates, the translation by dr. west is both original and good, but the parts that are good are not original, and the parts that are original are not good. after all, when one has the work of such a brilliant predecessor as benjamin jowett to follow, the temptation to do something entirely different is strong. but it must be resisted. if dr. west had merely lightly revised jowett's great work, he would have made a contribution to learning. alas, he did neither. 

the version by jowett is clearly superior. here is a short excerpt:

""and i must beg of you to grant me a favor: if i defend myself in my accustomed manner, and you hear me using the words which i have been in the habit of using in the agora, at the tables of the money-changers, or anywhere else, i would ask you not to be surprised, and not to interrupt me on this account. for i am more than seventy years of age, and appearing now for the first time in a court of law, i am quite a stranger to the language of the place; and therefore i would have you regard me as if i were really a stranger, whom you would accuse if he spoke in his native tongue, and after the fashion of his country: am i making an unfair request of you? never mind the manner, which may or may not be good; but think only of the truth of my words, and give heed to that: let the speaker speak truly and the judge decide justly.""

compare west's inept version:

""...i do very much beg and beseech this of you: if you hear me speaking in my defense with the same speeches i am accustomed to speak both in the marketplace at the money-tables, where many of you have heard me, and elsewhere, do not wonder or make a disturbance because of this. for this is how it is: now is the first time i have come before a law court, at the age of seventy; hence i am simply foreign to the manner of speech here. so just as, if i really did happen to be a foreigner, you would surely sympathize with me if i spoke in the dialect and way in which i was raised, so also i do beg of you now (and it is just, at least, as it seems to me): leave aside the manner of my speech--for perhaps it may be worse, but perhaps better--and instead consider this very thing and apply your mind to this: whether the things i say are just or not. for this is the virtue of a judge, while that of an orator is to speak the truth.""

""speaking...with the same speeches i am accustomed to speak""? how utterly inept and repetitive! didn't he even proof-read? one doesn't speak with 'speeches', one speaks with words!

it is obvious that dr. west never read his version aloud as a test of its appropriateness, which is surprising, because this work is supposed to be a speech. dr. west's version is clearly not suited to speaking aloud, whereas jowett's is. in west's translation, socrates is a clumsy, repetitive, and inept speaker. needlessly so. if you want to read a good translation, see jowett's 3rd edition (1892).

why does dr. west believe himself qualified to make translations? nothing in his work suggests that he is competent in any way to do so. this is not the work of a scholar, but that of a bungling hack. these translations are travesties. how does work this nauseatingly bad get published?

1011,"mcmurry's text is a very friendly, gentle intro to  organic. it's a thoroughly enjoyable read, but it doesn't teach you what you need to  know.  explanations for important mechanisms are usually very brief, and the  problems included are usually very basic and general (the spectroscopy and  synthesis problems, in particular).  if you're looking to become a chemist,  this is not the book to learn from. i'd recommend  vollhardt and schore's  textbook, or any number of sophomore-level texts that will give you the  skills you need to approach complicated problems more successfully (i.e.,  on exams or out in the industry)

2) the story lacked the depth of lewis' other wonderful books - where's the who/why/what that lewis used to moneyball (and others) educational - i wanted the story behind the story.

824,"at the young age of 25 julie barenson loses her husband. shortly after he dies, a great dane puppy is delivered to her home with a note from her late husband. this part will give you the chills ... nice touch.  she names him singer, and despite her frustrations with his size and clumsy mannerisms they grow to love each other.   after a few years of trying to get her life back together after her tragic loss, julie begins dating 2 men--richard, a handsome charmer who wines & dines her, brings her lavish gifts and professes his undying love very early in the relationship. the other, mike, is a simple down to earth country type whose idea of a date is a burger, doritos & a couple beers at the local watering hole.  so who would you choose? ouch! i'll stop there with the comment that this could have been such a compelling story.  instead, we are faced with trite, boring, repetitive dialogue throughout, scatterings of viewpoint shifts and a very predictible plot.  i cannot believe this is the same author who wrote the notebook, one of my all time favorite novels. i'll have to admit the ending brought on a gush of tears.  in conclusion, singer not only saved his owner but the book as well.

1510,"i am leading a christian study group using popular films.  i was hoping this book could help me use film to illustrate some scriptural truth.  unfortunately, the author was much less interested in a christian message than to make sure he took every opportunity to insult the ""church.""  i know that churches have problems and hurt people, but it is not as common as this author seems to assert.
he seems very angry at the church (and for some reason, all of western culture - especially america.)  living in n. ireland could make one suspicious of religion i assume, but despite his claims to be a chrisitan so concerned about commmunity, he seems to enjoy tearing down more than teaching and building up.
it is a good study of film (not movies - he definatley comes from a critical point of view and not that of an average person) but not very useful in the context of the church.
that's my take anyway.  god bless

1363,"i did not read the book but i did look it over carefully.  i was hoping it would be a clear step by step guide to using ibd to apply the canslim method.  there is so much information in the paper that it is not easy to apply all the techniques in an efficient manner.  there are almost too many choices and directions possible.  this book is not a step by step guide nor is it all that clear.  i did find it to be unnecessarily wordy and vague.  it just seems to go over the whole paper in a long winded fashion but does not get down to the nuts and bolts of &quot;smart investing&quot; as i was hoping it would.  refer to william o'neil's books for better guidance about how to invest.  also, if you are a subscriber, there is a large amount of useful information on the ibd website at investors.com
"
1892,"perfectly in keeping with the imperialist ethos that he so proudly and loudly espouses, boot has foisted upon us a book that rests entirely on the labors of others.  

lacking even the slightest trace of shame, he plunders concepts and ideas from anyplace in the intellisphere he chooses.  as a result, there's nary a new thought nor insight to be found anywhere within these pages.

even more pitiably, like a renegade third world nuclear scientist trying to ""sanitize"" his clandestinely-acquired apparatus of any markings that might possibly identify its source, boot assiduously scrubs away any subtleties and nuance that the original thoughts may have possessed.  one wearies quickly of the manichaean results.

and like any ideologically-driven but technically inept would-be nuclear (or social) engineer, he fails utterly in his attempt to enrich his raw material even minimally, succeeding only in rendering it more toxic and hazardous than it originally was.

why, even the title itself has been purloined from alistair home's 1977 underground classic, ""a savage war of peace""!*  considering that home's tome arrives at essentially the opposite conclusions from boot's, this is irony most profound.

it is scarcely surprising, then, that recent history has thoroughly discredited the philosophies and policies so ear-splittingly trumpeted in boot's book, thus rendering moot any lingering interest one might have had in perusing it -- unless one wishes to take counsel for the future by ruminating upon the ozymandian ruins of boot's espoused belief system.

831,"the working notes of this book are utterly staggering in their implication to ontology. what is being? merleau answers in the manner of lao-tse, and alludes to something like a divine-feminine at the heart of wild perception. it was said by sartre in his autobiography &quot;situations&quot; that after merleau's mother died who was like a &quot;goddess&quot; to him merleau returned began the project anew. what is intimated in the working notes is invaluable to the true student of philosophy and life.  and in the end, merleau returns to the very object of his study. you can really feel this descent at the book nears its end. it is, however, an ascent of the entirety of the history of philosophy to a new level of comprehension. that i assure you

1271,"""the other boleyn girl"" and ""the queen's fool"" are two of the best books i've ever read--and i've read a lot of books, especially about this period, which especially fascinates me. they were gripping to the end, and my involvement with the characters was complete--true masterpieces. so whenever a new book by philippa gregory comes out, i buy it, hoping to have the same experience, and lately have been sorely disappointed. ""the virgin's lover"" fell flat, and now i am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged, must give it up. one reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is always an easy guess, however it depends on the writer. anthony trollope, for instance, was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed. that may or may not be the case with gregory. i know, as a writer myself, that there are times when the work flows out, feeling almost as if it's channeled from another source, and times when it's harder, more mechanical. the more challenging situations are those when i'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. so to me, neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse. they feel forced, constructed. i'm going back to trollope

"
81,"the first novel of laurell k. hamilton's merry gentry series is not, actually, that terrible a book. it's by far the best in a not particularly great series, actually. what made it almost impossible for me to read is that the basic premise, the set-up, is one of the most grotesquely, ridiculously stupid things i've ever read. 

princess meredith nicessus has fled faerie, in fear of death at the hands of her aunt, andais, the queen of air and darkness and ruler of the unseelie court. high profile fae in this world are major public figures, like rock stars or the royal family of england. the sudden disappearance of one of the unseelie royals is a very big deal indeed. every news media in the world reports the story....and it never goes away. we are told solemnly that reports of princess meredith being spotted are right up there with elvis sightings. meredith's image, the story of her mysterious disappearance, is everywhere. i mean, neolithic pygmies living in deepest africa know who meredith is, and what she looks like. 

meanwhile, princess meredith has disguised herself as a mortal private eye. thing is, she hasn't disguised herself very much at all. her supernaturally pale skin is now humanly pale skin. her fae red hair is now human red hair. her facial features remain the same. and with everyone on the planet wondering where is princess meredith, for years on end, no one recognizes her. let me hasten to add, there is no magic involved in this, they honestly simply don't recognize her. and the crowning touch to this masterful disguise, the name chosen for her pseudonym to hide the fact she's actually princess meredith is....wait for it....merry gentry. 

jesus wept. 

and for years, none of her co-workers, no one who knows her, says to themself, ""hey, wait a minute, that women who looks almost exactly like princess meredith....merry gentry....princess meredith....oh my god, merry gentry is princess meredith!"" nope, she's just incognito, baby. 

at which point i almost threw down the book and said, ""you have got to be kidding me."" it's absolutely amazing to me this made it through the editing process. do laurell hamilton's editors do anything other than rubber stamp her writing? given her past six or eight novels, including this one, i'm tempted to say: no, actually

"
452,"the plot of this book was interesting, and it could have been a good book. unfortunately, it wasn't. the main problem for me was that the hero is dispicable, and the heroine has absolutely no self esteem! even many of the the secondary characters are weak, miserable people!

the story starts when the hero finds himself drawn to the heroine even though he considers her a ""dirty little nobody"". once she gets a makeover and is actually beautiful, he begins pressuring her to become his mistress even though she is an innocent marriageable female by regency standards. because she is the daughter of a ""cit"", he can't imagine why she has any reservations about the deal. he says charming things to her like ""how much do you think your virginity is worth anyway"". now that's romance! 

meanwhile, even though she is unbelievably insulted by the hero many times, she finds herself drawn to him too. for me their relationship was sort of like an abuser and his victim. she never stood up for herself, and you felt sorry for her.

of course the plot twist involves a mystery about her parentage... only its not really a mystery because almost everyone knows the hero is a dukes granddaughter, including her. in fact just about the only one who doesn't know is the hero, which provides the dilemma. he would of course be willing to marry her if only he knew she really wasn't a nobody!

will anyone tell him? will he wise up and offer to marry her even though she isn't good enough for him? will she give in to her desires and become his mistress since he doesn't think she is good enough for him to marry? of course it all works out, and he actually proposes to before he finds out she actually is good enough for him. ugh!!!

this could have been a good book if the ""mystery"" had been handled better, and the characters were written differently. as is, it is a sad regency tale
"
1501,"i personally do not see how this book could have won a newbery medal. while the author portrays sibling rivalry effectively, that is about the only positive aspect of this book. the fact that the teenage girl protagonist has a crush on an elderly man is disgusting and is presented as not only being acceptable but understandable. sara's family is also unsupportive to her sulky and jealous attitudes. her grandmother is a busybody and consantly antagonizes the family. sara's twin sister gets all the attention and love, leaving sara starving for parental care. finally, christianity is portrayed as harsh and judgemental. this book could possibly be acceptable for adults but never for children and i would not recommend it to anyone. i wasted my time with this book: please don't waste yours.

137,"      this book, ""the relatives came"" by cynthia rylant and illustrated by stephen gammell, was a delight to read. i found myself smiling as i read the words that made the artwork come alive. likewise, i found myself recollecting over the memories of the past when my relatives would come to visit. and, i felt as if i, too, were a part of this book. having experienced growing up in a small town where you don`t see that many people, i believe that when relatives come to visit, it almost seems like christmas. as a result, when the book expressed the joy, laughter, and celebration of family, it stirred up these memories of the past. unquestionably, almost anyone, from children to adults, could find themselves reminiscing and longing for the fun they had when their relatives come to visit.

1932,"from what i gather, edward abbey has somewhat of a cult following.  i had never read anything by the guy, never even heard of him before i got this book.  i just thought i should point that out before going on.

this book kept me reading, no doubt about that.  it has it's downsides, but overall, i'd reccomend it.  not ""hey, you gotta read this right now,"" but it's good if you're looking for something a little different.

this book kind of made me think.  i'm not the kind of guy who is always reading into a book trying to analyze every aspect of it.  but i couldn't help it with this story.  i thought a lot of it was psychological, dealing with the main character, his thoughts, attitudes, and what made him tick.

this is a fairly long book, but the actual story of the guy going back to his hometown is short.  the plot alternates every chapter-- one about where he presently is, and then a memory, then where he is, then another memory, and so on.  although it was an interesting way to write the book, i thought some of the memory sequences dragged a bit.  but don't get me wrong, overall i did enjoy them.

if you're looking for something that might be able to fuel a couple of thoughts about life, this is a good bookt to pick up

67,"i am not going to go over the contents of the book, or much about charles bukowski, because if you are considering this book you must know something about the man and his work. i will just give you my impression of this collection of work.
no collection can ever really be complete, there are always new things to add, new commentary, newly discovered works, transcripts of records and unpublished letters, but this book does an excellent job in its attempt.
to me charles bukowski will always be one of the greatest american writers of the twentieth century, because of the sheer brutality and honesty his work emanates. it is funny, sad, sadistic, cruel, scathing, enlightening and thought provoking. everything i like to read. this is poetry for people who are disgusted by verse of flowers, trees and greek mythology. this is raw human emotion and experience smeared out onto paper. it is not perfect, and it is not trying to be. it doesn't always work, but there in lies the subtle beauty of bukowski's efforts. the guts to try. the attempts at honesty, clearly blocked by his unwillingness to divulge everything, and his cynicism of man. 
this book has one of the most moving, amazing, and insightful poems...or anything else...ever written.  it is called the genius of the crowd. if you read that work of art and are not moved...nothing will.
this collection is shocking in its beauty, and inspiring by its simplicity. enjoy

"
505,"the book is not 'really' on christ in the etheric, but more several - ""unrelated"" - lectures about etheric life. sometimes christ only gets mentioned at the very end of a lecture.

the book can be summed up as an accumalation of lectures of ""cosmic life"" if you like: the spiritual life that is connected with, and influences, life as seen only from/with physical senses. 

in the book is recorded about several ""ages"" (golden age, silver age, iron age and dark age), and that how in each age clairvoyant abilities - [or really spiritual consciousness] - diminished with each age, and that the dark age has ended in 1899ac and that in this current age people need to become spiritually aware again to the point where they have a ""damascus experience"" (experience of saul - later paul - in which he saw christ in etheric form).
people who do not become spiritually aware will be bound into the earth consciousness/sphere and could cause disturbances in the earth.

in this light, rudolf steiner communicated about the brotherhoods - in western and eastern countries - and how they try to prevent people from developing spiritually to the point where they will be able to meet christ in the etheric (= 2nd coming of christ (coming in the etheric)... and in future times coming of christ (i.e. manifestation/presence of christ in the astral)).

in the book is also recorded about the sermon on the mount - with the beautitudes (recorded in matthew 5) where jesus communicated about the development of the soul (as recorded in other books by rudolf steiner (sentient soul, intellectual soul, etc.)). 

in the book is also recorded about ""the afterlife"" if you like: life of souls who have passed away and are still earthbound, and how those souls are connected to those souls that are incarnated in a physical body in earth.

in the book is communicated about different levels in the 'afterlife' and how feelings and will are active. it is recorded about astral plane, lower devachan and higher devachan in ""etherization of the blood"" and later on again in ""three realms between death and rebirth"" where is recorded in greater detail how activity in those realms is connected with life of souls incarnated in the earth and how christ is also present there and can be experienced in earthly life as 'destiny'... and how people are so focused on what is, or has happened, but don't pay attention to what is result of it not happening (e.g. getting delayed for an appointment, or coming ('unexpectedly') too early etc.). destiny is at work, with christ having its workings present in it according to rudolf steiner.

449,"this ""book"" is probably the worst written i've ever encountered. it was so flawed as to be considered literature. alice walker tries to ""one-up"" harriet beecher stowe, in writing about brutality. titles like these are weapons used in the anti-black male agenda this society has long perpetuated. all the men depicted in this book are one-dimensional characters with absolutely no redeeming qualities worth noting. the women are portrayed as martyred, forlorn, pseudo-saints who have been set upon by beasts from hell. 

the only persons capable of any sort of humanity are exclusively women. i've learned long ago, when absolutes such as these are presented, a greater agenda is at work. there are no ""real"" men in this book! only distorted caricatures of black masculinity. i only found value in this book as a comprehensive example of sexist misandry at its worst. i find this title as dangerous as hitler's ""mien kampf"", in it's portrayal of black men as evil and morally destitute. 

presenting such depictions is both dangerous and irresponsible. true, there are criminally abusive men in every culture. but there are also forthright, upstanding  men as well. to present a depiction of such vehement imbalance and disparity, only serves to distort the readers view of the people being written about. 

harriet beecher stowe's fictional ""uncle tom's cabin"", sparked national outrage and eventually a bloody civil war. this title does no less in further distorting the readers perceptions of black men. 

this book is fiction. however,it is not presented as such. i'm sure the abusive incidents depicted in this book have been based upon actual incidents. i have no qualm about outrage at such abominations. however, i do have a problem when there are absolutely no upstanding male figures who intervene in such aberrations. that is what i find so unbelievable and offensive about this book. 

in my opinion, this novel does nothing to laud the strength of women so much as it demeans and distorts the readers/viewers of the people within it. i don't find it a testament to the strength of black women at all. i interpret this book as feminist misandry with two purposes...the further distortion of african-american culture and the deliberate depiction and denigration of the black male as being hopelessly inhuman.

i'm sure alice walker made a lot of money with this book. feminist, racist extremism seems to have found a niche in literature. i wonder if this novel would have had the same accolades, were it a fictional depiction of white american men brutalizing white women. most definitely not!!! i doubt it would have even found a publisher. america is comfortable reinforcing negative depictions of black men and african-american culture.

my life as a black man is difficult enough living as a testament and example against this sort of racial distortion. whatever ms. walker's motivations were in writing this novel, i'm sure mercenary incentives were not discounted. 

this is racist, misandrist propaganda masquerading as literature!

605,"perhaps the long shadow of francis parkman has discouraged historians from writing about the french and indian war (seven year's war).  whatever the reason it's good to see from the publication of several books that americans are taking a renewed interest in the pre-revolutionary period when the british were triumphant and the indians still counted as a political force.  

it's past time for a thorough revision of parkman -- who was ungenerous with the indians although i thrilled as a young reader to his descriptions of their ferocity -- for example, the ""insensate fury"" of the iroquois.  actually, the iroquois were less insensate than they were astute.  

calloway omits the bloody details and vivid writing of parkman but he gives us a thorough picture of what happened in the wake of the english victory over the french in north america.  in particular he focuses on the frontier and the built-in conflict of american settlers, british policy, and the indian tribes who either went down to defeat with the french or were betrayed by perfidious albion.  they made their point, however, in pontiac's war and by clearing white settlers from the frontier. but their  numbers were declining and they would soon be overwhelmed. 
        
this is a good book about the issues of the frontier between whites and indians.  in addition, there's a good account of the french movement from canada to louisiana and the spanish rule in florida and the trans-mississippi.

111,"this book still does not address many areas i find interesting in james brown's career but i find it a natural companion to the three other jb books in my collection: cynthia rose's ""living in america: the soul saga of james brown""; geoff brown's biography ""james brown""; and ofcourse, the brown/tucker ""the godfather of soul - james brown"". all three dig deep into this metaphysical musician's mind but this one has a stronger narrative, a bit less guarded: his late '80s fall is described in a more contrite way, for example. his scientific study of his audience is perhaps something new in his dialogue - but he broaches the subject of how music motivates women in a different way than it does men, then immediately moves on to the next thought. even by 2005 standards his live albums contain some of the most overt sexuality, obviously directed at the female fans, ever recorded. similarly, his admonitions to admonishes contemporary rap/hip-hop artists are eloquent but must be deemed a bit self-righteous: there is alot of ""adult"" content in his catalogue which can't be explained away as ""art"". however, fans can trace his development into more ""cerebral"" music, with more and more sensitive ballads and socially-conscious tunes being produced  from the late '60s on.
i was happy to read his description of little richard's assistance in his early career, but a bit disheartened when he suggested that penniman was basically a rock and roll raver - i find it hard to believe that this publication brought out his true feelings about his georgia neighbor - the influence is quite obvious and not just on ""chonnie on chon"". another depressing ommission is with marva whitney, his popular lead female vocalist from c.'67 to '70. a recent documentary reveals that marva traveled to vietnam with the star but here he simply says that he was only allowed to travel with a small part of his musical backup.  
despite the above concerns, with this book james brown has shown the literary world that he is a writer. ofcourse this was obvious to the musical world - just listen to ""don't be a drop out"", ""i don't want nobody to give me nothing"", ""the man in the glass"", ""i'm not demanding"", ""it's christmas time"", and ""peace in the world""

1423,"homesick: my own story by jean fritz is a story about an american girl who grows up in china. she spends a good part of her life wishing she could be in america, where she belongs. when she's not doing that, she's

and learning british culture in school.
	as you can see, jean fritz would be an excellent storywriter had she made it up. however, this story is an autobiography, and is in almost no way fictional. jean fritz is an excellent storywriter anyway, though. jean fritz describes the setting as if her pen were a plane ticket. her story line makes it difficult to locate the plot, or even understand the full story. the autobiography is punctuated by emotions. all in all, this is a fine educational history text, but is not, in my opinion, a fitting storybook

1681,"[...] 
  if you are curious about the cambridge patonists, patrides carefully edited selection of texts gives you the cream of the crop! - benjamin whichcote, ralph cudworth, john smith, henry more et al. - material reprinted from the original texts, complete with all the archaic but fascinating english spellings. the texts are fully annotated with comparisons and 
references to a wide range of cognate works. 

 if you are reading the cambridge platonists as part of an academic exercise or are otherwise familiar with their milieu, well and good. you will know what to expect. i think it is worth saying something here - for the general reader. i am sufficiently 'unmodern' (or perhaps 'un-postmodernist') to
read the cambridge platonists because i think they still have something valuable to say! 

 not everyone would agree with me - but, i think the portrait of benjamin whichcote which graces the cover of this book (and the frontispiece) says something about the sort of men we are dealing with. (the portrait still hangs in the gallery at emmanuel college, cambridge). there is composure in that expression. it seems to infuse the whole being of the man. it is the expression of a mind which has found calm waters,
seen eternal verities. 

  one of the papers in this book - ralph cudworth's, was preached as a sermon before the house of commons (i.e. the british parliament). things are different with us today. we are no longer certain of eternal verities. it seems almost incomprehensible - now, to think that when the cambridge platonists were expounding their ideas in the 17th c., they were touching on matters of concern to most thinking people.
religion and science had not yet parted company (despite being called a 'father of modern science' in school books, issac newton was a deeply religious man, very much in tune with the ideas of the cambridge platonists).   

 the great beauty of the cambridge platonists, is their calm confidence, their utter conviction that there are eternal verities, that reason and faith are complementary faculties. thus, on the one hand, they looked back to the philosophers of antiquity (strictly speaking, they are neo-platonists, taking in everything between plato, plotinus, ficino/renaissance thought, even hermeticism) - and the legacy of christianity, while on the other hand - they were alive to the emerging 'scientific' spirit, the renewed quest to understand the principles ordering the phenomenal universe. for them, there was an intelligent - and intelligible order in the universe. for them, reason (capital r) still had its pre-kantian, classical sweep. 'reason' was not a mere idea in the head, an itching in the cranium, but presupposed the divine nous (intellect), intimately connected with the activity of a divine energy (energeia)informing the pattern of the universe. we find them preaching against false religious 'enthusiasm' - as soundly as they preached against atheism. 

     ""good men spiritualise their bodies; bad men do 
      incarnate their souls. "" 

     ""we are no more than second causes; and our
      suffiency is only in god, who is the first.
      a second cause is no cause, divided from 
      the first. ""

1245,"that so many people gave this book five stars really concerns me. luckily, i bought this book used, otherwise i might be kicking myself for paying full price. between her utterly uninspired ""devotional dances"" to things such as sex, wisdom, and the ""sticky one"" (a term she made up for the astral body), and her constant blabber about masturbation and rubbing your juices all over everything to ""anoint"" it, i was unimpressed, to say the least. however, driving on a trip a friend and i got a lot of laughs out of flipping through this book. it's very, very amusing if you don't take it seriously. the thing that makes me sad is that she's just using her sexuality to sell a feel good waste of paper with absolutely no depth. there's nothing evolutionary about it, unless you consider being a wanton, idiotic freak ""evolutionary"". if this is what humanity is evolving into, i am frightend
"
803,"`the savory way' is an early (1990) book from leading vegetarian cookbook author, deborah madison so, as ms. madison has a new book on the way, i thought it was high time for me to catch up with her body of work so i can give an informed review of how her new volume fits into her other books.

ms. madison is a former colleague of alice waters and lindsey shere at chez panisse who specializes in a very general way, like mollie katzen and madhur jaffrey, on dishes that fit into a vegetarian lifestyle. note that the term `vegetarian', especially as used by these three authors, is extremely misleading, as it is much more appropriate to say that they construct meals of everything under the sun except meat, fowl, fin fish and shell fish. both madison and jaffrey make extensive use of milk, cheese, yoghurt, and eggs.

madison's objective in this book is, in fact, to cover as broad as possible a survey of what can be done without using animal flesh. the book's title may be a bit misleading to some foodies in that `savory' is often one of the words used to divide dishes in two great groups of `savory' and `sweet'. this book in fact includes two rather long chapters on sweets.

a first look at this book shows lots of headnotes to the many recipes. the first thing you need to know if you are put off by `chatty' recipe books is that these notes are almost exclusively devoted to an understanding of the cooking involved with the recipe and how to get the best results from your ingredients. while little stories about the historical provenance of a recipe may interest many, including myself, that is not what this book is about. on top of this, i firmly agree with the blurbed opinion from mollie katzen who compliments both her cuisine and her writing. almost all professional culinary writers are pretty good, or have an excellent copy editor at work on their prose, but ms. madison is a food service professional who writes very well. i often wish the soon to be beknighted jamie oliver had a bit more talent with words, as i find his books so comforting in spite of the heavy contribution from his editors.

the very first attraction of the book is its table of contents, which lists every single recipe title in the front of the book. this is doubly useful in that this relatively long book divides recipes into chapters covering eleven different types of dishes suitable for just about any time of the day, including a good selection of recipes very good for breakfast. the eleven recipe chapters are:

quick bites with 40 pages of recipes for sandwiches, toasts, and spreads.
salads to start or make a meal with 42 pages
soups and stews with 50 pages of thick, thin, and pureed soups, including a new one with my favorite fall ingredient, chestnuts.
eighteen quick pasta dishes for five and company, 32 pages
stovetop vegetables, 27 pages of sautes and braises.
baked and roasted vegetables, 25 pages with ratatouille, gratins, tians, and other goodies.
grilled vegetables and their sauces, 11 pages with two to six sauces per grilled dish.
down to earth, 26 pages on rice, potatoes and beans (although beans appear throughout all chapters!)
morning foods for day and night, 26 pages of eggs and cheese and cereals and breads.
finishing touches, 31 pages of sauces, salsas, condiments, dressings, pastes, and you name it.
desserts, 45 pages on fruit dishes, cream cheeses, pastries, and custards
sweetmeats, 12 pages on sweet pastes, peels, syrups, dried fruits, and other dessert dressings.

every recipe i examined is relatively simple to prepare with fewer expensive or rare ingredients than you may find with jaffrey or jack bishop, and great tips on understanding the recipes and the ingredients.

the appendix is just right for the occasional home cook who is lost in the forest of equipment you can find in a first rate kitchen supply store such as the second floor at zabars. ms. madison puts it all in perspective by highlighting all my favorite tools such as gratin and tian pots, the mortar and pestle, a few good knives, the food mill and the pizza stone and peel. the chapter on the pantry has lots for the novice and a few good tips for the foodie, such as the fact that mexican olive oils can be very spicy. possibly the best items in the appendix are the lists of dishes for special purposes such as entertaining, feeding large groups, and fitting into a low fat diet (note that for the number of recipes in this book, this low fat list is surprisingly short).

the list of sources is short with no internet sites provided, but i recognize that virtually all of these vendors are still in business. the bibliography is also brief, but hits all the right titles, especially joy larkcom's excellent `the salad garden'.

this book is a great resource for `liberal' vegetarians who simply eschew meat. i would add this to madhur jaffrey's `world vegetarian', peter berley's `the modern vegetarian kitchen', and jack bishop's `the complete italian vegetarian' to create a great core vegetarian library. i cannot at this time compare this to ms. madison's other books, as this is the first i have read, although i sense many of her more recent books have a narrower scope, focusing on vegetable dishes. i plan to review her other books in the next few days.

highly recommended for both vegetarians and foodies in general.

61,"hugh farnham is a blue-collar survivalist who likes to play bridge.  his college-age daughter karen, her friend barbara, his lawyer son duke, his alcoholic wife grace, and house servant joe are playing cards at his house the night the bombs hit.  everyone scrambles to safety inside hugh's modern bomb shelter.

as the bombs fall and his wife is passed out, hugh starts up an affair with his daughter's friend barbara, right in the shelter.  as if hugh's shallowness and arrogance wasn't enough to turn you against the protagonist, this nauseating little scene will.

when the shakes and quakes finally end, the family pours from the shelter to find themselves in an impossible, pristine, clean world.  at first glance, it looks like utopia, but then as they settle into a rustic lifestyle they are suddenly set upon by an advanced race, imprisoned, and brought into a vastly different culture as slaves.  somehow, hugh needs to find a way to break free of the civilization they are trapped in, so that he can be free with barbara.

of all the apocalypse fiction, this book is the worst.  the protagonist is so lowbrow, so arrogant, so unlikable, so self-centered, so shallow, so immoral that he simply cannot capture any interest.  he's not even a ""love to hate"" person.

the dialogue is flatly emotionless and yet irritatingly flippant, and barbara and hugh's constant prattlings of ""darling, dear, and beloved"" do not fit the characters.  neither does hugh's occasional spouting of words like ""shall"" and ""shan't"" along with racial diatribes that include heavy use of the ""n"" word.

there is little emotion from these one-dimensional characters even though they face the death of hugh's daughter and barbara's friend karen, cannibalism, castration (hugh cared more about his ""boys"" than he did his real children), pedophilia, racism, and $exual slavery, they show no more feeling than they would biting into a doughnut.

the entire plot-over-plot had a contrived and vapid feeling to it, as if the author himself didn't quite believe his story.  and if he doesn't believe, how can he expect the reader to?

overall, there is no depth or flavor in this story at all, other than the ugly aftertaste of a musty trailer park visit in the dusty twilight, as old men drink cheap stinking whiskey and the wind blows over the city dump next door.  i recommend avoiding this book.

206,"no doubt about it.  this book covers the history of the border patrol.  however, it falls far short of what it ostensibly bills itself and ends up more as a ""fluff piece"" than anything else.

as someone who has not only served as a senior border patrol agent (13 years) but also a border patrol union president and outspoken critic of the agency, i have studied this agency inside and out without the affects of tunnel vision that typically accompany the job (many say a necessity).  pacheco, as an active agent (when he wrote the book at least), appears headed in the right direction with the book and then suddenly veers off target.  his somewhat ambiguous message that border security is a difficult task is obviously an attempt to straddle the line (i apologize for the pun) so as not to appear too contentious or controversial.  did he need to seek agency approval for publication since he was actively employed?  if so, then the credibility issue leaps out and the book is worth the historical content alone if nothing else.  if he did not need agency approval and was truly writing without restraint, then he failed to accurately convey the real state of the border patrol and border security.  

simply put, the border patrol, as with most of the homeland security subcomponents is disintegrating.  remember the incompetence of fema (a homeland security subcomponent)?  well, multiply that incompetence times ten.  heard about the poor morale of fema employees?  multiply that problem by one-hundred and you have an accurate picture of the border patrol.  a border patrol in which the vast majority of otherwise employable agents spend ninety-percent of their time trying to get out.  those that choose to stay in do so only because of the comparatively worse off agencies in dhs.  the bottom line is that as a former agent, i lose sleep at night knowing what i know.   

pacheco did cover the rigorous training regimen accurately even if it bordered on propaganda.  that alone may attract candidates to the difficult and completely unrewarding position of u.s. border patrol agent.  the field stories are completely unappealing to anyone who served more than a week in a law enforcement position unless they are reading about their own exploits.  

read the book for enjoyment and homage.  just don't expect critical analysis.  in fact, this book would be an enjoyable read at stewarts bridge (for you ib agents in san diego).

282,"anyone who reads this book would not be surprised at the runaway success of the &quot;left behind&quot; series, since it demonstrates that a preoccupation with bible prophecy affects a much wider demographic than the fundamentalist subculture. indeed, the impact of premillenial thought has extended all the way up to the reagan white house. and, christian or not, who hasn't heard of the term &quot;antichrist&quot; or the significance of the number &quot;666&quot;? this book presents a fairly comprehensive survey of popular eschatology, including the role of israel, russia, the arab countries, europe, and the united states. it also shows how those beliefs have changed over the years (turkey was considered gog and magog before russia was, and the pope was designated as the antichrist for years before hitler and henry kissinger came along). the final chapter, written at the brink of the collapse of the soviet union, demonstrates how, once again, premillenial thought adjusts itself (or sometimes not) depending upon world conditions. this is a fair, even-handed treatment of a religious and cultural phenomenon

725,"dave barry has written and selected an extremely humorous collection of his articles from the miami herald.  there is a huge margin in difference of quality in boogers are my beat than in his initial non fiction books such as dave barry's bad habits.  boogers are my beat is one of those rare books that once you start turning the pages you don't want to put down until the back cover.  dave barry educates his fellow man on a diverse range of topics such as why you can't use the towels hanging in the bathroom, the salt lake city olympics, babies on airlines, north dakota, bear in the big blue house and cell phones to name just a few.  

his article written the day after september 11 and one written a year after, about the philadelphia crashed plane are also included which prove barry could have been a serious writer if he had pursued that career.  thankfully he didn't because the rest of the book is hysterically funny as is his carl hiaasen style fiction novel tricky business.  big trouble isn't bad either. check them out along with his other non fiction novels as well.

29,"harvey e. goldberg is one of the pioneering sociologists in the study of the jewish communities of north africa, especially  the libyan-jewish community. in this present work he brings to bear the experience and knowledge of a lifetime of study and practice as a jew to provide an overall historical, anthropological view of the jewish life- cycle. 
he opens with a chapter on 'being jewish' then  considers  birth, circumcision, naming . he goes on to discuss 'rituals of education' and then has a central chapter on 'marriage'.an  especially innovative section is  on 'pilgrimage and creating identities'in this one he opens one of the central themes of the book, the way the increased importance of the individual in jewish life and thought has led to more varied religious practice.  his chapter on 'death, mourning and remembering' also includes a consideration of communal remembrance. this is not as might be expected his closing chapter, as he adopts the traditional teaching which he is reminded of by  one of his many interviewees, and  ends with something 'good' his final chapter is on 'bonds of community and individual lives'. 
this book is extremely well written and a delight to read. i especially enjoyed the instances where he brings in personal anecdote to illustrate and deepen a set of observations. goldberg has a true command of traditional jewish religious sources, and these texts form one real basis of his life. but what is especially exciting is his reading the communal variations across time in response the religious and communal demands. 
as one long familiar with much jewish tradition and ritual i was surprised again and again by new observations and insights. anyone who loves jewish learning will love this work tremendously. 
i cannot recommend it more highly

114,"i truly enjoyed northern lights.  ms. roberts ways with words are so descriptive and it kept me going with the mystery and growing love between the two characters in this book.  i truly enjoy nora roberts, she is an excellent writer.  i cannot wait to read more of her newer writings as well as her older writings.

1525,"this unforgettable story illustrates the crazy, life-changing adventure of a seventeen-year-old boy who struggles to let go of his fading childhood and accept the phoniness of the adult world. holden caulfield's loneliness and lack of motivation combined with a traumatic childhood cause him to leave behind his youthful days at pencey prep to venture into the dynamic adult world of new york city. holden tries to hide his youthful innocence as he mirrors the habits of other adults, going to bars, drinking, and purchasing prostitutes. however, his bickering and sarcastic attitude suggest a hidden desire to stay young, a desire he stubbornly buries beneath his new, mature lifestyle. holden, like many others, longs to live in a place that is simple and motionless, a place where one needn't worry about the past or the future. holden also hopes to preserve the innocence in others, such as his sister, so they don't turn out like him, depressed and regretful. through salinger's vibrant attitude towards holden's experience in new york, we readers learn to stop running from our past to prevent losing our youth altogether. the catcher in the rye has survived generations as one of the world's best bildungsromans, not because it illustrates the fading youth and growing maturity of a memorable character, but because it demonstrates the confusion of a character as he fights desperately to protect what remains of his childhood

1085,"first off anyone who gave this book five stars was employed by the publisher to up the rating that simple. i mean look at some of them they are so cheesy one of them actually refers to the author as mr. miller who is he brown nosing for sounds like a greeting card they are so ""textbooky"" and insincere. the book itself is almost entirely filler on how to read music (which half the music books in borders are or they are just giant scale books that are reemed out like saw dust totally useless,  which leads to the great difficulty on how to actually find an explantion to this jargon and then someone comes along and says they have an answer that will make things clear but then they fall short)  up until half the the book and many times periodically things are just repeated terminology loosely defined such as hook which is just recording industry jargon not theory. book never goes into the physical principals that would actually explain some things in it as to why the notes themselves are in the order they are such as acoustics, never got an answer as to what a whole step or a half step was by the way and when i asked many teachers and questioned them they knew nothing or gave a circular answer defining it themselves without an outside reference only to find that they were just parroting it all along. the problems with this is everything is assumed in the entire field. i recommend the only book that i have found that made some sense to me called fractals in music by charles madden much more organized and assembles things from the very beginning working into more and more complex shapes and structures.
"
1876,"perhaps it has a lot to do with the book being written in english (or at least it appears to have been, there is no translator listed), but this is by far the most lucid thing i've read by latour. in a way it's a radical break, he finally embraces his troubled intellectual child actor network theory, stops expecting its meaning to magically emerge from the context and sets forth exploring what it actually is and how it can work.

775,"a recent dallas morning news column profiling t.d. jakes quoted a university of houston sociology professor saying that jakes is ""incredible in how he's able to diagnose people's pain.  he has an uncanny ability to put a finger on the human condition."" jakes' new book he-motions illustrates the verity of the professor's statement.  in he-motions, jakes nails the issues and challenges christian men face today in trying to fulfill their many roles and pursue their dreams.
	
jakes writes from his heart and soul as a pastor, father, husband and entrepreneur.  in the opening pages, he describes his motivation for writing: ""i want to share what i've learned.  i want to cut through so much of the junk imposed on men today and talk heart to heart about what it means to be a man, not in some touchy-feely group hug kind of way but in an honest, soul-bearing way, which also respects men and honors the women who love them and whom they love.""
	
jakes thoroughly succeeds in fulfilling his desire for this book.  not only does he address male readers, but he also targets female readers who hope to gain insights about men.  jakes' no-holds barred writing offers refreshing candor for those wanting an honest assessment of who they are and where they are in life.
	
jakes writes about his childhood, his ministry, his family and his ups and downs in life-always tying stories to life lessons for readers.  it does not take the reader long to discern that jakes possesses a vast breadth of wisdom and understanding about the inner workings of men in our culture.
	
jakes writes that ""a man must value himself.""  he-motions can help readers make great strides in finding value in themselves-regardless of their circumstances.  he encourages men to refuse to become discouraged but to keep moving toward their destiny while simultaneously enjoying the splendid moments of life's journey.	
	
the book is written as if jakes is in the room having a one-on-one talk with the reader.  if it was in fact such a talk, it would surely involve laughing, weeping, praying and dreaming.   one such example of the conversational style is when jakes writes about balancing family and career.
	
he writes, ""i'm here to tell you that if you don't contain your work life and segregate it from your home life, then your career will consume the marriage like a campfire blazing outside of its circle of rocks and roaring into a life-threatening forest fire.""
	
there is not an area of discussion where jakes lets men off the hook.  he writes authoritatively about power, money and sex.  in the financial arena, jakes commands readers, ""stop asking god to bless an area where you refuse to obey his word for your life."" 
	
in one relationship area after another, jakes' writing leads the reader to self-examination, awareness, forgiveness and improvement.  his writing on subjects such as a man's relationships with his father, children, wife, other men, time, money and god is honest and down to earth.  it is also practical, as are the questions for men and women at the end of each chapter.  

throughout the book, jakes references the life of david to shed light on the above relationships from a biblical perspective.
	
jakes encourages readers that ""someone needs to know who you are and where you are at all times in your walk and life.""  this book could be an effective tool to use in a discussion or accountability group to help people grow stronger relationships.   i encourage men and women to take advantage of the wisdom and insights jakes shares in this book
"
38,"though i am not a vogue reader, i picked up this book out of curiosity to see what anna w's splashes in the tabloids were all about.

while the subject is only mildly interesting to me, the author's prose reads like a 300+ page deposition against anna wintour from everybody who had/has a major or minor gripe with her. it's a heavy and boring read.

gossip, if one can get over oneself and admit that it is entertaining, should remain light and diverting. in this book, it is difficult to garner much sympathy for the subject or its author, much less derive the slightest enjoyment from it. i was very happy to put it down. 

perhaps this lackluster effort will compel someone else to attempt a better job. but then again, when that time comes, anna wintour may be have disappeared completely from public interest

"
742,"casual book browsers who stumble across braden's book, ""the isaiah effect,"" might undoubtedly be drawn to the implications of the title: that there exists some mystical, unifying code which is only now being fully understood through modern techniques, research, and understanding. i, as one such browser, had briefly read about the so-called ""bible code"" which computers have now enabled man to explore and thought that the subject of this book might be related. with my interest piqued at the title and the book description, i delved into the pages expecting to learn exactly what encompassed isaiah's ""precise instructions"" of prayer. i wanted to know exactly what braden claimed to have stumbled upon.

what i found in this 250 page foray into countless subjects was nothing other than a pastiche of new-thought concepts. the mixing of religions, for example - a sort of pick-and-choose spirituality which has slowly been creeping its way into the mainstream for decades - is recycled over and over again, drawing from endless sources of gnostic gospels and other lost books. in only one chapter does braden actually begin to describe in detail verses from the book of isaiah. instead he relegates the books of the essenes to positions of higher authority and prominence.

in the brief pages in which braden actually does discuss isaiah, his conclusions speak nothing of a decoded lost science. his basic premise of ""the effect"" is that people can alter their futures by the choices they make in the present. such a revelation is not a new interpretation of isaiah at all. any student of the bible and christianity knows that all the prophetic books of the old testament are records of god warning israel, and the world, of turning away from him.

to braden's credit, his discussions of the effects of prayer in today's society are commemorable, albeit somewhat misguided. i agree with him that people in today's society need to turn away from the petty details of life with which they've surrounded themselves. however, i believe braden over-emphasizes the role of feelings and emotion in prayer. he fails to discuss how humans, and their emotions, are extremly fallable and can change as quickly as the winds in his anecdotes.

braden wants desperately to believe that the true power of prayer is to be found in all the lost science which he has uncovered in ancient texts. in the process he fails to recognize that the blueprint for prayer has been known to man ever since he was created. humbleness before god and the filling of the holy spirit are the true keys to prayer - not cosmic emotions and human feelings.

a disappointing read
"
400,"this book is very readable because it is oriented to the general reader. chapter 1 gives his short autobiography as to why he became an anthropologist, and his experiences in kenya. a forensic pathologist is a medical doctor trained in pathology. a forensic anthropologist has a ph.d. and studied anthropology, specializing in the human skeletal system. chapter 3 tells about his laboratory, and the tools used for his work. chapter 4 has many of the cases he worked on. chapter 5 notes that most dismemberments result from the drug trade or motorcycle gangs. the interstate highway system provides arteries for crimes and serial killers. (p.63). chapter 6 discusses cases of suicide. many people kill themselves without intending to. it is important to distinguish between murder and suicide (p.86). page 87 tells why florida has an inordinate number of suicides. chapter 7 explains how forensic anthropology developed in response to murders. this chapter discusses some famous cases of this relatively young science. page 101 tells how to distinguish between bone from rock by taste! chapter 8 says bones are not solid and unchanging, they are constantly reshaping themselves.

in chapter 9 maples tells of the use of capital punishment (p.128), and discusses the various methods (pp.129-131). he seems emotionally involved. chapter 10 informs us about cremation. chapter 11 has maples' most difficult and most fascinating and perplexing case. the two dead in high springs fl were linked to a shocking double murder in new hampshire (p.152). page jennings' parents made a big, fatal mistake in sending their daughter so far away after her failure as a freshman (p.164). chapter 12 deals with the mia in vietnam, about 2200 compared to the 8170 in korea. hollywood movies created this popular image of captured men (p.187). a ""delusion"" (p.188)? maples describes the us army central identification laboratory that identifies remains recovered from vietnam. page 202 tells what happened at the executive office building. chapter 13 tells of his investigation to recognize the skeleton of pizarro, and correct an old mistake. the exhumation of president zachary taylor and the tests for arsenic poisoning are told in chapter 14. page 224 tells of his importance to those times: he backed free states in the new territories. his replacement changed his policies.

chapter 15 may be the most historically important. maples was part of a team that identified the bones of tsar nicholas and his family. maples draws political conclusions from ""rotten, neglected teeth"" (p.259). chapter 16 tells of the murder of five college students over two days in gainesville florida. maples identified the murder weapon (pp.271-273). the book concludes with the complaint that states are not funding forensic anthropologists, who are few and far between, especially in florida (pp.278-279). florida is ""the most crime-ridden state in the union"". that is a political decision for each state government. this recalls the most realistic portion of ""quincy, m.e."": whenever quincy wanted to do more research, his manager often said ""there's no money in the budget""!

1800,"this book provides fascinating details of what life was like for children in colonial america: how they played, what their education was like, what they wore, etc. the information is drawn from such primary sources as letters, journals and school primers. there are a number of pictures as well. i recommend it

499,"i was intrigued by the title, which supposedly links jedi wisdom to christianity.  well, after 60 pages or so, i have got the feeling that the staub is trying to wrap jedi in christian cloth and failing at that. the author speaks of the difficulty in leading a christian life.  but, i say that any religious life (be it christian, islam or otherwise) is hard because it turns the back on the norm or the conventional. 

i am convinced that yoda is a zen master; the force is derived from tao, not god as interpreted by the orthodox religion(i am purposefully leaving out christian mysticism, which is another beast altogether.). a better book on the subject of theology in star wars is ""the dharma of star wars.""

879,"i have been a fan of sue henry since her first jessie arnold mystery.  i was looking forward to reading her lastest adventure, but was very disappointed in this outing.  the characters were one-dimensional.  after discovering who the ""bad guys"" were i needed to reread part of the book for clarification.  sue henry has a very annoying habit of foreshadowing at the end of many of her chapters.  ""...they hadn't a notion just how decidedly things could - and would - change in the next few hours.""  even the relationship between alex and jessie seemed stilted.  i realize it is difficult to create plausible mysteries for a civilian like musher jessie arnold, but this book tried too hard and accomplished too little
"
1796,"as a follower of the celebration story for many years, i was greatly disappointed by what i thought would be a new and interesting perspective on the model town.  it was nothing of the sort.  the book had the feel of  so many pages of anti-disney propaganda, and the repetitiveness of a bad  serial.  the authors of celebration u.s.a. clearly made up their minds  about celebration long before signing off on a mortgage.  lacking in the  detail needed to illustrate celebration's experiment with the tenets of  neotraditional style, the book offered splashes of cliched generalities  such as ""a return to the past"" and ""recapturing tradition.""  it soon became  some sort of mantra exhorting disney's ownership of the town, the rules  imposed on property improvements and maintenance, and, interestingly, the  attention the town received.  most tactless of all was the shadow of  mockery cast on every description of residents, conversation with  neighbors, and interaction with people doing what the authors should have  been doing: giving the town a chance

1016,"this is the latest in a never-ending series of books trying to generalize non-business world (eg. sports, armed forces, girl scouts, religion, nasa, etc.) management techniques to the business world. 

most, possibly all, are of little value because of major differences. 

1)members constituting the varying organizations are motivated differently, and face greatly significantly different situations. what does eg. a fighter pilot or football coach have in common with a pharmicist, nurse, professor, financial analyst, etc.? i have no idea. 

2)key success factors vary from one business to another. for merck, it may be speed of developing new drugs, getting through fda approval, and motivating physicians to use them. for nucor steel, it undoubtedly rests much more on low-cost production. again, what does either have to do with fighter pilots - little, if anything. 

one is better off reading books from similar situations - eg. about wal-mart (if you are in retailing), about allied-signal or g.e. (if you are managing a conglomerate), and about new york community school district #4, as managed by sy fliegel, if you are in public school

484,"sacred pathways is easy to read, plain, balanced, and straightforward.  the book surveys 9 different spirituality types.  for each type it identifies scripture, historical characters, styles of worship, and dangers.  the book contains an evaluation tool to help the reader identify his or her personal spiritual personality.

as with any survey tool this book does not go deeply enough into any particular spiritual practice.  it doesn't need to.  what it offers is an excellent service to the christian community.

for those who are trapped in a church that worships in a style predominately different from the their own, this book offers the knowledge that the reader is not alone.  there are others out there that worship in the same way.

for those who believe that all true worship looks like their style of worship this book offers a broader view of the christian landscape.

i gave this book 5 stars because it could have a potentially life changing impact on those who have lived in a closed environment.

1334,"this was a book that finally answered my wife's questions.  she is a theologian (main stream, liberal.  evolution is ok) and deals with science and religion frequently.  she kept asking me of my biochemical research ""is it predictive?"".  what she was asking was from my studies in protein structure could i predict the taj mahal?  i mumbled a great deal during those conversations.  

in this book mayr give voice and coherence to the chaos that is biology.  it is not the science of physics, where one equation rules all.  choices, and accidents happen, and they shape future development.  that is who we are.

i recommend this book to anyone really interested in what biology is, and what is can say about how it has arrived in this place and time.

1957,"i didn't have especailly high hopes for this book. i think there has been a gradual decline in the quality of hh books over the years, and this one brings it to a new low. basically, it's waaaaaay too long. at 850 pages, it's a monster read, and a slow one. that's not always a bad thing - sometimes if you like the characters it's nice to just hang out with your friends for page after page. but not here. why is it necessary to describe in detail the exact movements of a treecat using sign language? for several paragraphs? more than once? why are we given pages of liturgy for religious services? i think i'd be in a very small minority when i confess that i quite like the 1662 prayer book, though i can't quite work out why it would be revived in the distant future when it's been out of use here for decades! maybe it was easy to cut and paste, and got the word count up.

and then there's the space combat - a strength of the series, especially the first three or four. but there's the rub - there are only so many ways you can describe a spaceship blowing up. by the 11th book in the series i can't be the only person out there whose eyes are beginning to glaze over when we get to the battle sequences.

but the big problem - spoiler alert! - is the way in which weber solves the love triangle we left the last book with. honor loves hamish. emily loves hamish. hamish loves honor and emily. what to do? it turns out that there's an easy solution. after about 400 pages of agonising (not to mention most of the previous book) it seems that honor can marry them both. a bit outre? seemingly not - apparently such arrangements fall well within the accepted norms of manticoran law and custom. (although we've never had a whiff of this before.) but what really gets me is that the reason it didn't happen about halfway through the last book is that (get this), gosh, no-one thought of it. it seems that no-one ever told mr weber that if you shoot someone with a gun in act v, the gun better have been hanging on the wall in act i.

all-in-all, i can only say, please mr weber. it is time to bring the series to an end. please do it soon
"
1739,"i am not going to repeat other reviewers discussion of the lack of character development.

my issue is with the lack of basic research.  one incident has hawke's zodiac being fired upon by a french patrol boat's missile.  bell uses the harpoon missile as the weapon.  the french have their own very effective ship to ship missile in the exocet.  very unlikely that the french would use an american made harpoon.  later in the novel, hawke is taking off from a carrier deck in the latest vtol aircraft, the f-35.  the catapult fails and hawke is put in grave danger.  my problem, this is a vtol aircraft, which the author goes to great lengths to mention and describe.    why would there be a ""cat shot"" at all.  vtols are designed for vertical takeoff and then transistion into level flight, which, again the author describes.  also this scene has nothing to do with the story.  just another ""saturday cliff hanger"" episode.

this is my second attempt at a ted bell novel, assasin being the first.  there are too many other writers out there than give a sense of believability for me to waste my time on this type of thriller.  i believe the author has the ability to create a very good novel.  i wish he would cast aside the unbelievable and go with something a little more creditable
"
966,"the setting of this book is beautiful, exotic, and interesting. the author, unfortunately, does nothing to take advantage of this. i am shocked that this book could possibly have won a national book award. it must mean that either the award itself is meaningless, or that there were some truly dreadful books out that year -- which i doubt. the topic of this book could have been more ably handled by just about anyone else, as far as i am concerned. i can't imagine it being done worse! tuck's writing style -- short vignettes or episodes, one after another -- is terribly ineffective and disjointed. i felt completely detached from all of the characters. i didn't feel like i gained any understanding of who they were, and was unmoved when they died or otherwise encountered tragedies. another thing that completely irritated me were tuck's sexual references. throughout the novel, tuck would end her lame vignettes with one or two sentences mentioning some crass sexual encounter (a finger inserted in an unmentionable place or a character participating in a masturbating contest, for example). these sentences seem to be thrown in just to shock or perhaps to intrigue the reader; all they did was gross me out. they were written in such a way that they seemed to have been written by a teenage boy, not an adult woman trying to tell a compelling story. i don't know what tuck was trying to do in this novel. i think she has failed to write anything that succeeds on any level: it is not entertaining. it is not profound. it is not educational. it is not beautiful. at only 248 pages, i can't say it was even a quick read. utterly forgettable, once you get past the irritation of having wasted your time reading it.
"
380,"first off: i'd like it better if we had 1/2-star options. judas unchained really doesn't deserve a 2, more a 2-1/2 or 2-3/4.

i have a love/hate relationship with peter hamilton's books. he's very adept at introducing interesting technology and making a faster-than-light society plausible but, as with a lot of these hard-science, libertarian sf authors, he badly needs an editor. i was skipping over multiple pages of irrelevance in both this book and its prequel, pandora's star. he also has far too many ""main characters"" who (despite 800+ pages) never seem to come alive. they all speak with essentially the same voice. and when he tries to individualize someone they come off as badly stereotyped '60s era hippies -- come on, does anyone seriously say ""dude"" in the real world much less the imagined future of the 24th century?

and why is hamilton so obsessed with sex with young (or rejuvenated) women?

hamilton's treatment of virtual immortality is hit and miss at best. on the one hand, the innate conservatism of an immortal civilization is well developed, represented and believable. on the other hand, the dynamics of the relationship between ""old timers"" and ""first lifers"" is unsatisfactory. in four centuries, for example, no one has even attempted to unseat nigel sheldon from his position as head of the sheldon dynasty? perhaps the commonwealth's continual expansion is the safety valve but even here, the government (controlled the eternal heads of these dynasties) controls it. another point that is brought up briefly is why would anyone want to live forever if their life didn't change -- i mean the characters of a novel (almost by definition) are dynamic, go-get-'em types but most people just plod through their lives and then die. why would anyone want to do that for lifetime after lifetime?

the aliens are ok. the problem with them (and this is true of nearly every sf story) is that they tend to be one dimensional -- they're all of a singular type and all too often they really do just act like human beings with weird make up. (this is a problem in fantasy stories, too.) on the plus side, i do tip my hat to hamilton for not allowing the humans to save themselves with an alien ""deus ex machina."" ozzie's adventures in ""wonderland"" (i.e., the silfen paths) do bring him to the adult silfen and he does find out the origins of the dyson barriers but the knowledge doesn't really help anyone defeat the primes.

overall, if you started with pandora's star, you probably should finish the journey with judas unchained. if you haven't started down this ""silfen path,"" i recommend alistair reynolds, tony daniel or iain banks. they write similarly grand space opera but are better at it than hamilton has proven himself to be to date
"
224,"i tried, i really did, but i couldn't get beyond 100 pages.    i love iris johansen books but it seemed she had no joy in writing this one, almost as if she were forced to do so.  it contained none of her usual style.  the dialogue was choppy and boring and nothing made you care about the characters.  i'm still a fan and hope the next book is written in more typical ij style. 
"
426,"""...minus several million for good thinking...""
- zaphod beeblebrox, the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy

the above quote (and the score i've assigned to this book) aren't in reference to the text or the author, but to the publishers. why anyone with the brains of a sea urchin would cross professor hawking as they seem to have done is beyond me.

briefly, save your money and buy the illustrated brief history of time instead of the theory of everything, even if you're a compulsive hawking completist. alert readers should notice that hawking doesn't hold the copyright for theory of everything, and attempted to block its publication. it was originally titled the cambridge lectures: life works, and appears to have been drawn from some recordings of lectures given by the professor years ago. (see the professor's web site for details.)

the ""vanilla"" (i.e., not the illustrated) theory of everything consists of an introduction, seven lectures, and an index, without *any* illustrations or diagrams. out of curiosity, i compared a library copy of it with the illustrated brief history of time.

unless otherwise noted, each of the 7 lectures corresponds to a chapter of the same name in brief history, in some segments only with slightly different paragraphing and punctuation (and occasionally the kind of spelling errors that creep in when one transcribes audio narration to text, if i may speculate as to the cause).

i don't understand why anyone would prefer the less polished text of theory of everything to the illustrated brief history of time, which not only has updates for new areas of research, but has been revised and rearranged to explain things more gently to the layperson.

""ideas about the universe"" is essentially an extract from ""our picture of the universe"", the first chapter of brief history, with about one sentence's worth of drift per paragraph.

brief history's version of ""the expanding universe"" has a more gradual introduction to the methods of measuring distances to nearby stars, and explains technical terms that may be unfamiliar to the non-scientist, such as luminosity.

theory of everything really shows its age in ""black holes"" when compared to brief history, as hawking has not been idle in that area over the years. the illustrated edition of brief history has had a fair bit of interesting material added to ""black holes"", especially regarding cosmic censorship and naked singularities (hawking having made a few *more* bets on the subject with preskill and thorne, although he paid off the cygnus x-1 wager).
 
""black holes ain't so black"" lacks major blocks of clarification/explanation added by hawking to the version in brief history.

brief history's version of ""the origin and fate of the universe"" goes into more detail: about the kinds of particles that are predicted to have come out of the big bang, and what sort of results we'd expect to see today if the predictions hold, and the scientists who first put forward these theories. brief history also contains a much longer version of the ""open questions"" section, leading more gradually up to the discussion of guth's development of the inflationary model.

""the direction of time"" corresponds to brief history's ""the arrow of time"" (which is worth picking up just for the picture of the keeper of the u.s. cesium clock). brief history goes into more detailed examples to explain what hawking means by the psychological arrow of time, with the simplest kind of ""computer"": an abacus.

""the theory of everything"" mainly corresponds to brief history's more modestly titled ""the unification of physics"", which is much more up to date (string theories are still covered, but a lot more work has been done in that area over the years). the tail end of the lecture corresponds to the ending of brief history's ""conclusion"".

--

in summary, this is interesting stuff, but the illustrated brief history of time does it better

1137,"i dedicate this review to women all around the world of all colour,races,religions,nationality and creed...(all women are equal,in my eyes....nigel..)

in this remarkable novel,sk makes his debut.an unlikely but good book.it has a good dose of horror/suspense and it is one of the best books i have ever read...

it is simply about a teenager from maine,named carietta white(carrie).from the beginning of the story we see who her mother(margaret white)takes advantage of her,making her feel stupid and left out.similiarly in school,carrie is always the ""black sheep"",she has not friends and she is always picked upon.she is very unusual and strange,at least to most people,especially the ones in the book(story).(but i would say quite frankly that i didn't see here as anybody but a normal healthy teenage girl.)

at the beginning of the story we also see that carrie has her first period while taking a shower at school.she is laughed at and all the other girls throw toilet paper and tampons at her.this is her first big humiliation.(i am a guy,i know not much about a period,so please forgive my use of the term openly)

anyway,back to the plot:carrie soon realizes that she is psychic.she starts to practice using her powers gradually.it seems as though she had the powers since birth,but the powers were dormant until puberty or at least she was unaware of it.

so,so far we see this:a very unusual girl with psychic powers and a stupid mother.
the story initially and mostly circulates around these facts but things get a little messy towards the middle and end.
allow me.....

it is later revealed in the story that the psychic gift is sort of genetic.carrie's mother explains alot of things,but she is still a bad mother.
(but i still can't hate carries's mother,because most mothers are sort of protective over their children)
soon carrie gets her first friend sue.sue feels sorry for carrie and helps her to get a date for the prom.
this date is tommy ross...

meanwhile,one of the bad girls,chris,is unable to attend the prom.so,she sets up a nasty revenge against carrie.believe me when i tell you,chris is a very jealous girl and if she can't have something,no one else can,especially carrie.

so chris arranges a trap for carrie.(two buckets of pig blood)
she sets it up for the pig blood to fall on carrie's and tommy's head while at the prom...
the plan eventually succeeds.
tommy is badly injured.
drenched in pig's blood,carrie is laughed at,for the last time.she runs out of the building.she then remembers her psychic powers and decides to use it for revenge.
she starts to close all the doors.she then turns on all the water sprinklers,wetting everyone.
but with a combination of water and electricity(from the appliances)....some were electrocuted.
eventually a fire gets started.and things start to burn!
she walks toward her home,burning everything within a certain radius of her powers.
when she reaches home her mother tries to kill her,telling her that she is the spawn of satan.she eventually uses her powers to stop her mothers' heart beat,killing her.
eventually(this is the good part of the book),while carrie is walking on the streets(going i don't know where)she seens chris and chris's boyfriend driving towards her,to bounce her.
carrie uses her powers to diverge to car,killing chris and her stupid boyfriend.
sue eventually catches up with carrie.carrie doesn't kill her because she realizes that it wasn't sue's falt but chris's.
(during the battle with her mother,carrie was stabbed,i forgot to mention it,sorry.)

so,now,talking with sue carrie eventually breathes her last breath and speaks her last words and just,dies.(this is the sad part,i guarantee you that it would bring tears to your eyes,or maybe not)

but this book is definitely good,i recommend it with all my ""psychic"" powers.

enjoy.............this review was written by nigel....

"
1751,"peter balakian's book, ""black dog of fate,"" tries to be too many things
and sadly fails at many of them. in essence, it is an attempt to tell a 
sort of armenian-american story which i find not overly interesting or
 compelling. i wish the author had done a bit more in-depth work to learn 
about his people and their rich heritage before embarking to represent it
or explain it or share it with non-armenians, for he has much more to absorb
and understand himself first. i find the armenianness in this book to be 
tentative, unengaged and unconvincing. pity, since the author seems to 
have a lot of passion in his pursuit of other aspects of his life such as 
football, the yankees, modern poetry, and exposing turkish attempts to
buy (among others) princeton professors to act as mouthpieces giving
legitimacy to their vile historical revisionism, practiced by the 
""modern"" turkish state and its organs.

it seems to be all the rage these days to elevate personal histories and 
family testimonials into the realm of fiction and novels. the ""i"" and ""we"" 
and ""us"" occupy center stage and the reader is invited to enjoy the 
intimacy that must surely be in place via this artifice. but is it realy?
since in order to make this legitimate, the writer must distance himself,
at least initially, from all this old world exotica, and like the reader,
question their validity or relevance in present day north american 
society. what are all these old world, old fashioned ghosts and traditions?, 
is the first cry of writer and reader alike, only, ofcourse, to be followed 
by a sharp bank turn where the writer steers the satisfied and in-place
reader towards the opposite viewpoint wherein *this* culture and *this*
lifestyle become suspect in light of some tentative spotting of cultural 
wealth that has been traded in or abandoned in order to swim swiftly towards 
materialistic, memory-free, self-redefining, ""comfort"" seeking and buying 
mores.

in the balakian tale, one encounters suburbia instead of substance, 
worldly goods acquisition instead of deep roots that steady the soul, 
immediate family and relatives running away from their true identities either
towards surrealism, the abstract and unemotional, or else towards medicine,
respectability and detachment. young balakian observes but never
understands ""the grandmother"" for she is shielded culturally from being
able to reach him by her very offsprings who can not and will not instill
the armenian identity he will eventually seek but never quite find. their
crime is self-denial and a march to the tune of america's mixmaster
piper. ""be unlike your past and your future will be brighter,"" seems to be 
what america promises, at the very least. the intermediate generation listens
and adopts this credo and peter is left to find out but never quite
understand just what cost his ancestors have paid to remain armenian and
to preserve our culture before the final denials on new jersey pateos while
enjoying, as if to serve sweet irony, full course armenian meals and the
mixing aromas of delicacies from the old country every sunday.

peter is lost alright, but as the book sadly shows, he remains lost.
paraphrasing or quoting ambassador morgenthau does not an armenian genocide
expert make. personal family testimonials of the turkish atrocities does
not a genocide history make (for that, read vahakn dadrian's ""the history 
of the armenian genocide""  berghahn books, 1995). episodic accounts can be 
dismissed by the turks as hear-say and as mere isolated incidents, leading 
to more harm than good (for if better evidence existed, the arguement 
goes, why would anyone resort to such flimsy fare?). for the story to have
worked, for the story to have *really* worked, as i would have liked it to,
balakian's life and lifestyle would have had to have changed
significantly and his child rearing practices would have had to reflect 
it, and his relationship with his wife who, like him, is not leading a strongly
armenian existence, would have had to have changed, solidifying his roots,
celebrating his new found identity, and nurturing the metamorphosis by
sustained community involvment and grass roots movement participation
which, alas, never appear on the pages of this book. how else to explain
the lack of a turning around of the tide of assimilation to which balakian
is a grand personal witness, except that the transition has not occured?
the ship of armenianness sails by balakian. he is finally aware enough to
be able to identify the ship and wave it goodbye and write about it, but
not resolved enough to climb aboard. that is how the book fails and that is
how his story fails. this is a story of assimilation and loss with a bit of
mid stream self awareness thrown in. for a real story of an armenian
finding his roots and letting them take root in his own life and future,
read mark arax's book, ""in my father's name (simon & schuster, 1996),""
where the transition is real and the early youth of disaffection is
replaced by a profound adoption of our essence revealed in exquisite
frankness and power by mark arax. one can only hope that balakian's
partial reorientation towards our culture and traditions and essence will 
somehow continue and that some day he will wish to live with a more meaningful
attachment to our cause and needs than merely as an able observer (not
withstanding his laudible actions as an april 24th -- armenian genocide
commemoration speaker and an exposer of turkish infiltration in the us
academic arena by buying spokesmen turned professors who mascarade as
unbiased researchers). this criticism i direct to the predecessor of this
genre of american armenian writing first and to balakian second. i speak
here of ""passage to ararat"" by michael arlen (hungry mind republication,
1996) where a disinterested soit-disant armenian goes to armenia in the
70's and by the end of the short trip is somewhat more closely touched by
this strange people's woes and dreams. too little, too late, and always
detached, is all i can say to these meagre displays of ethnic or cultural
reorientation. much more needs to be absorbed before the essence is
transmitted to future generations to take and behold.

however, i remain hopeful that future transformatory stories and ethnic
identity survival stories *will be* written which will show that the tide
of assimilation and cultural abandonment are not the only outcome of this
experiment of transplanting peoples and cultures to this continent we
proudly call our home

1468,"a little about golf and 'inside the pga tour'... plenty of gratuitous language 'n ornery texans... mostly about dan jenkins' views on relationships with women... forced a couple laughs
"
809,"always lively and perspicacious, this clever book seeks to solve a seemingly trivial puzzle: while historians have mustered a host of plausible explanations (weapons, diseases, horses, etc.) for why europeans spread so thickly into north america, australia, new zealand and argentina (the lands crosby labels ""neo-europes""), what could possibly explain why the dandelion did so as well? the question doesn't appear so innocuous when it is pointed out that not just the dandelion, but the european housefly, and feral pigs, and a horde of other weeds, pests, crops, diseases and livestock from europe followed suit. quite often these organisms, even the domesticated ones, raced ahead of european explorers themselves, rapidly proliferating into vast herds and stands that the settlers themselves could not fathom. why was this so? why didn't, say, australian weeds, their seeds inadvertently shipped back to england, eventually carpet the meadows and fields of europe? to answer this odd question, professor crosby begins his story with pangaea--the great supercontinent that began to split apart about 200 million years ago into the continents we now have scattered about the globe. these ""seams of pangaea"" then forced a radical divergence in the terrestrial flora and fauna of the planet, and set the stage for the equally radical convergence initiated when european mariners crossed these now mid-oceanic seams. crosby details case after case in each category: weeds, pests, livestock, diseases and crops. he forcefully illustrates how sudden and overwhelming the ecosystem takeover was until the suspense is too much to bear. what is the answer? he drops clues every now and then, and the most explicit one is in the form of a quote that begins one of the final chapters: if weeds are to be defined as those organisms that thrive on the disturbances caused by humans, then humans themselves must be considered the primary weed of all. here, then is the answer: all the opportunistic fellow-travelers of the european diaspora are exquisitely coadapted to the scale and pace of the continuous ecological disequilibrium characteristic of the old world civilizations--and they, in turn, furthered and helped generate that very disequilibrium. together--humans, horses, cattle, pigs, rats, clover, peaches, measles and, yes,  dandelions--comprised a potent self-replicating system, dimly discerned by its contemporaries, that could not be stopped once it spilled across the seams of pangaea
"
1152,"there was nothing in this book that our association hasn't covered nearly every week.  i was very dissapointed.  it offered little tidbits like &quot;a postgame review can help you learn from experience&quot;.  don't we all do &quot;postgame reviews&quot;, even if it is simply going over the game in our head on the drive home?  i certainly do.  no, i'm not he best umpire in our association.  i would rate myself as somewhere in the middle.  the book offered me nothing new, nothing that our association doesn't talk about constantly.  buy a childress, or save your money
"
601,"i recommend this book highly for anyone who is losing a close family member or friend to illness or who has lost someone and just are having a hard time coming to terms with why
"
885,"it starts out like laura bush's rules for driving, but skydives after the opening pages, in which the then 17-year-old laura kills a young man with her car, who just coincidentally happens to be her boyfriend!  

my interest in the book sharply dove after that, as it appears that coincidental killing is the most appealing thing about laura bush
"
1711,"this is a great beginner's guide to home buying.  the advice is straightforward and the explanations are easy to understand. 

buying a home is a scary and daunting prospect for me.  i kept getting a lot of conflicting advice from relatives, friends, and coworkers on when to buy, what to buy, and how to buy.  this is very frustrating as everyone means well, but what worked for them might not apply to me. and don't bother asking a realtor or mortgage company if you should buy--they make their living on our decisions to buy! 

so i bought home buying for dummies to learn more, and it has a lot of sound and thoughtful guidance to help decide when and how much to buy...  and also how to find a good home, and then negotiate with the realtors, the sellers, the mortgage companies, and everyone else that is sticking their hands in your wallet.  

the author's advice is realistic, and he points out the pitfalls of jumping in and what trouble you can get into with the different loan options out there
"
1720,"this is my first ludlum book and it is sure to be my last.  the plot is preposterous because of ludlum's limited understanding of economics and history.  once you realize that, all interest in the story falls away.  it starts off plausible enough...and the blurbs on the jacket imply some ""weapon"" more powerful than a mere 270 million dollars!  hitler gained power because of the alignment of a number of situations that made the ground fertile for his brand of megalomania.  some spoiled, rich american brat and his fortune would hardly make a difference to the currents of history.  i know that this is only supposed to be a work of fiction, and it is all in good fun, but the plot-concept needs to be much more believable to hold my interest.  if you don't need logic in your fiction, it's interesting enough as a cloak and dagger story, but it falls far short in the historical (and economic) fiction department
"
1483,"cryptic and confusing muddle of mush. if this is the ""new style"" of writing, we are in trouble folks.
"
1170,"i thought this was the most boring book i've ever read! i hated it and about 1/3 of the way through i quit reading it
"
1965,"i bought this book just recently and was really touched (and cried) by the whole experience that gus had went through. he has lost the one friend that gave him a second chance (stephanie) and without her, he could've been out there on the street again. overall, it's a good book to read and i always believe that man and animals can be best friends and learn from one another, this book is a genuine prove.
"
954,"expect everyone to maintain a peaceful hush as you read this book aloud. a sense of serenity permeates through the words and is perfectly matched by the illustrations.  the imagery captures your senses and the story pulls at your heartstrings. grandfather twilight is an endearing character that makes you feel warm and safe. this wonderful book is sure to appeal to all ages (preschool to an older adult).  and, it isn't just for bedtime either.  
"
1074,"as i read this book, when madeline was young, i felt as though i was lost, wandering through a forest, searching for something - a beautiful butterfly, a perfect flower, a mystical cottage.  but there's nothing there.  it's just a forest full of a confusing tangle of leaves and vines and nothing mystical at all. and that's how this book is written.  it is a tangle of thoughts and words, spread from the first page to the last.  nothing special at all.  

i've read all of jane hamilton's books.  i loved the book of ruth.  adored a map of the world.  they were both wonderful and i will always have positive comments for them, but i doubt i will ever buy another book by ms. hamilton.  it's not that i want a ""formula"" book.  but i do want to read something that i can relate to and i don't relate to this at all.  

i don't like mac, the narrator.  his mother is just plain strange and not endearing or believable at all.  i can't stand buddy, his cousin.  the rest of the characters i barely know and, quite frankly, don't want to get to know.  perhaps i've changed since her first book came out.  perhaps the author has.  but whatever the differences, my love of jane hamilton's books has ended.  sadly
"
842,"as crow puts it, if it had not snowed on that monday in march.  the snow led to a chain of circumstances with crow bringing a homeless teenager home for dinner and a place to stay for the night.  it turns out that the teenager, lloyd, was a witness to a crime, and that draws tess into the case when she connects lloyd to a news reporter.  events disrupt her life as the case develops and federal agents demand that she reveal the name of the source.  the story starts with a narration by crow, and alternates between crow, tess, and other characters in the story.  you will get a lot more crow in this novel than in others.  the story has an interesting ending, and you can wonder if lloyd will show up again.  you get some information along the way about baltimore soup kitchens and the homeless, and a view of the underside of society where life is sometimes cheap
"
582,"this was a very informative read.  i have gotten so many great ideas and will be using many of them in my own coastal garden.  this is much more than a typical gardening how-to book.  there is so much wisdom here and also some interesting facts.  organic gardening is my first love and i was pleased to see ms. hadley insist on it in her own garden.  a garden by the sea reads like a story as well as a great resource for gardening information.  i agree with the other reviews here, it is like talking with a friend.  this book has become a treasured addition to my library
"
1086,"i would like to know what kind of a wuss needs to use a stradegy guide for a first person shooter!?  i mean, they're pretty straightfoward - walk forward and kill all the bad guys you see!  how hard is that!?  halo is an awesome game but it's really not hard to figure out what to do!  i mean you'd have to be a complete moron not to know what to do or where to go.  it tells you more than once what to do during the game - you got that extrememly annoying cortana yacking in your ear pretty much non-stop, tellin' ya what to do.  but anyway i'm done ranting at you wusses
"
403,"communism is one of the most evil ideologies in human history, responsible for the extermination of 100+ million people. this book (which started it all) holds at least much of the blame. communists were and still are a threat to the free world, and communism is a slave system. some ""intellectuals"" actually support the tired mantras of marx's philosophy, whether because they are insincere or simply pedants who haven't seen enough sunlight, i don't know. in any case, if they ever step foot in the real world they would take note that communism denies private property, and is totalitarian and slave-driving (the government owns everything, including you). and the deaths caused by communism are hardly necessary to bring up. pol pot, mao, stalin (of course), etc etc...who are these people kidding
"
730,"rather a funny novel, gets off to a slow start but the end is superb. worth reading
"
1811,"in this book, dulles offers a simplistic yet useful overview of the way the church has been viewed throughout its history.  he focuses primarily on the catholic church.  from dulles' analysis, there are five basic ways to understand the church.  he explores how these models have been used over time, as well as their particular strengths and weaknesses.  in the rest of the book, dulles explores some of the issues surrounding ecclesiology.  he has also added a new model which is a synthesis of the other five.  my only complaint about the book is that it makes divisions too simple and straightforward.  rarely is there a church that fits all of the descriptions of one model or does not somehow combine several models.  the book is helpful, however, to pastors who seek to understand the thought patterns of the members of their church.  it is also helpful to congregants who desire to understand more fully what it means to be the church.  all things considered, this book is an asset to pastors, students, and anyone involved in ministry
"
1385,"let me say right off the bat, i am a skeptic, but still i loved author gary goldschneider's first two books from this series: the secret language of birthdays and the sl of relationships.  but this one, the secret language of destiny is a bore.

rather than offering two pages to each birth date, as birthdays did, or a half of a page as relationship did, this book gives the reader a short 1/4 page paragraph that allegedly sums up the destiny of those born in each of the 48 personology periods. this information is so general and by the way so boring that it could relate to anyone if in fact you don't fall asleep reading it.

for this reason, i do not recommend the secret language of destiny.

"
1947,"the prologue of this book lead me to believe this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing the love of her life and finding love again.  i was disappointed, soon after, when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts, with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle-and then even that was disappointing.  i mean graceland for a first date?  i noticed a lot of similarities between roz and the mayor in northern lights, and logan and nate from that same book.  none of them can talk in complete sentences.  and stella, who comes across as this loving mother, who puts her kids before anything else, works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down around everybody if she isn't there to oversee everything, even though the place has been successful for years.  there is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband, she just does it. unless, of course, it was in the last 50 pages which i didn't bother to read because i just couldn't torture myself any longer.  and i'm a big fan of roberts.  i love her quinn brothers books and a lot of her other work.  but this just stunk because i could really care less who the ghost is going to turn out to be.  i'm certainly not going to suffer through the last two books to find out.
"
270,"ernest hemingway dies on page 161 of this 300-page book and so does author valerie hemingway's story. for that reason this book merits only two stars. early in her story of meeting hemingway in spain in 1959 at age 19, valerie is aware of the author's magnetic and dominant personality, ""around him everything came to life....there was an urgency and vitality that...did not ebb.""

when she stays focused on the story of ernest hemingway, this is an endearing look at the older, struggling hemingway finding temporary renewal in the freshness of an innocent irish girl who entered his life during the final drafts of ""a moveable feast.""

but the youthful time spent with the famous writer works against this memoir since she was clearly neither as dedicated a correspondent or note taker as her subject. as a result, her recollections are thin and easily available in other sources such as a. e. hotchner's ""papa hemingway."" the two years she spent living and traveling with hemingway through spain, paris, key west, cuba, and america, share as much space as her weird marriage with hemingway's strange son, gregory (apparently the other ""bull"" referred to in the title). 

it shows the continuing vitality of ernest hemingway - even in death and over 40 years later - that a valerie hemingway can find a book deal for her meager remembrances of such a great man

39,"i was very impressed to find this very nice book. i've heard about a quebecois who painted for the popular singer celine dion (i'm from quebec, canada myself), i wanted to see and i'm very proud of it. huge ceilings and wonderful murals !  wow. felicitations

"
1039,"""the other boleyn girl"" and ""the queen's fool"" are two of the best books i've ever read--and i've read a lot of books, especially about this period, which especially fascinates me. they were gripping to the end, and my involvement with the characters was complete--true masterpieces. so whenever a new book by philippa gregory comes out, i buy it, hoping to have the same experience, and lately have been sorely disappointed. ""the virgin's lover"" fell flat, and now i am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged, must give it up. one reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is always an easy guess, however it depends on the writer. anthony trollope, for instance, was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed. that may or may not be the case with gregory. i know, as a writer myself, that there are times when the work flows out, feeling almost as if it's channeled from another source, and times when it's harder, more mechanical. the more challenging situations are those when i'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. so to me, neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse. they feel forced, constructed. i'm going back to trollope
"
1131,"this version of the old favorite is an interactive delight, engaging all the senses of reader and listener as they sing and play their way through the story.  each page offers endless possibilities to captivate the interest and attention of the youngest ""readers.""  the progressive repetion of the song makes learning it fun and easy.  all the colorful digressions, especially the silly commentaries on each page, can lead to more fun & games. wonderfully illustrated; sturdy pages
"
1383,"i do not recomend this book because the author gives poor explanations. in chapter 5, he explains steady state error for unity feed back horribly. he says the value of c(t) must be infinite or nonzero, but doesnt bother to show why. this book needs more work making concepts clearer and making less assumptions. 

its not all bad, but its not 5 stars everyone else has given it. i have read good textbooks, this isnt one of them.

779,"i've read many books on meditation and while each of them answers some of my questions, jack kornfield's book, a path with heart, answers every one save those that must be experienced first-hand in one's own time.  his  voice and advice is articulate, intelligent, humorous, open, patient and  wise.  he starts out by telling you a little about his own experience, goes  on to cover the basics of vipassana meditation and then leads you bit by  bit deep into the issues every meditator and spiritual seeker must face.   what i love most about his teaching style is that he gives gentle,  practical advice on the day-to-day, minute by minute stuff to do to  explore, commit to, love being on the path.  if my house were on fire and i  had to grab only one book on my way out the door, it would be a path with  heart

104,"this pocket companion serves as a concise overview of the most important facts &amp; concepts from the parent textbook (guyton's textbook of medical physiology).  however, it does not contain all the details or some clinical relevances, that's why you have to go back to the parent textbok for furthur info

1901,"wow, this book should be given to every graduate entering the workforce along with their diploma. not just about cards, but also contains business etiquette, marketing tips and techniques, and (un)common sense. wish i had read it 20 years ago. required reading for pretty much anybody who has to go out into the world and deal with another person
"
1635,"i love how many people like to say that lawrence walsh was a republican. funny. he was an eisenhower republican worlds removed from the conservative movement. and let's face it: he stink bombed george h.w. bush at the end of the 1992 campaign when bush was gaining ground on clinton. i'm not saying bush would have won if walsh hadn't indicted caspar weinberger on the friday before the election, but walsh made a next-to-impossible task unattainable for bush. bush got him back, of course, by pardoning weinberger on christmas eve, 1992.

the beginning of the book was interesting to say the least. as it wore on, however, it became a prosecutor hoping to go down in history whining about republicans. let's face it: people in power tend to be corrupt. they have protection the rest of us don't have. this wasn't just true about reagan and bush; it's true about clinton and whoever you wish to name. about halfway through the book, walsh concentrates his fire on the guy who was vp at the time, ghw bush.

i also find the fact it was endorsed by a number of liberals interesting to say the least. i guess when you can't beat a guy at the ballot box, you impeach him or at least try to.

right?

not worth the investment of time or money - but does have some good historical information inside.
"
592,"the emotionally unavailable man should be added to everyone's self-help library.  ms. henry clearly identifies and defines the problem, then prescribles manageable steps for healing.  her energetic writing style involves the reader right from the start.  even those who do not suffer from emotional detachment will find this book engaging.  most may even identify loved ones who either exhibit this or who are involved with someone who exhibits this behavior.  clearly this is a book for our times.

1324,"the sun shines, planets orbit, corporations lie voraciously, humans consume mindlessly and noam chomsky - the pre-eminent intellectual of the modern era - churns out knowledge, elucidates the times and refutes the notion that it is our manifest destiny to perpetually suffer indignity.
in a wide-ranging series of question and answer sessions chomsky tackles a myriad of seemingly disparate topics, which ultimately pertain to and concern the economic and political system and the welfare of humanity. unlike books authored by chomsky himself which tackle specific topics understanding power - the indispensable chomsky is the transcript of sessions traversing a decade during which chomsky takes questions from the audience on a number of topics ranging from us foreign policy, imperialism, trade and the third world to propaganda, corporate media, solutions to the collective malaise and the march towards a more just system and society. expounding on his legendary encyclopaedic knowledge and command of logic, professor chomsky manages to offer the questioners, and by extension the readers, a radical approach distinct from the boilerplate and mind-numbing discussions of the corporate media. refuting the suitability of handling our problems by working within the system and nibbling at the edges chomsky offers an alternative to the broken system without resorting to the expected customary answers like a broken record. 
as thoughtful and brilliant as the discourse is, the book's editors also deserve much praise not only for the compilation, but also for the easy to read format and the lively pace of the book. understanding power could easily have been entitled understanding the system and is a brilliant book based on the profound teachings of a brilliant thinker
"
1661,"i am not sure why the author thought he had something to offer on this subject.  there was no original thought or useful lessons on the topic that was promised by the title.  i read this book because it was the subject of an on-line book club for public health leaders but will be much more discriminating in the future regarding the purchase of books that are recommended by this group.

1465,"i recently re-read antony and cleopatra prior to attending the colorado shakespeare festival's performance of the ambitious play under the summer stars here in boulder. drawn from sir thomas north's 1579 english version of plutarch's lives, william shakespeare (1552-1616) produced this romantic tragedy late in his career, around 1607, and published it in the first folio in 1623. it tells the story of a doomed romance between two charismatic lovers, roman military leader, marc antony, and the captivating queen of egypt (and former mistress of julius caesar), cleopatra. when his wife, fulvia unexpectedly dies, antony is summoned from egypt to rome to mend a political rift with octavius by marrying his recently widowed sister, octavia. of course, this news enrages passionate cleopatra. she vents her anger on the messenger, but is quick to realize that octavia is no real rival to her when it comes to beauty. however, antony soon follows his heart back to cleopatra's arms, abandoning his new wife in athens. this leads to war, when octavius declares war on egypt. after octavius eventually defeats antony at alexandria, cleopatra sends a false report of her suicide, which prompts antony to wound himself mortally. antony dies in his lover's arms, and rather than submit to roman rule under the new caesar (octavius), the heart-broken cleopatra asks to have a poisonous snake delivered to her in a basket of figs. in the end, antony and cleopatra is as much about new sparks re-igniting the flames of love as new political forces supplanting old political regimes. it is a play that reminds me that it is perhaps better to re-read and understand shakespeare than to devour one bestseller after the next.

1033,"   while i am only a high school sophmore, and i don't have a *real* job, this book has been very helpful in deciding what to shoot for doing. i've heard people call this book too vague, but they can't tell you exactly what to do; it doesn't work that way. once you get through the personality quiz portion, the author gives a somewhat detailed description of your specific personality type (i for example am and enfp) and throws in suggestions in the description and also give a modest list of other possibilities. i'll admit it was a bit vauger than i had hoped but it gives you plenty of room to move around and a great place to start. 
   i'm lucky i found this book when i did (and not 3-4 years into college) because i found some satisfying  career options that i would not normally have chosen for myself and they are on the opposite end of the spectrum from what i was previously considering. (looking at this run-on sentence, you will be relieved to know that none of my choices are to be an english teacher)
   overall, this was a good book. there was a lot of filler describing the different personality characteristics that i found redundant only because i have gone over this in school a couple times. however, if you are unfamiliar with this territory, the explanations will be quite helpful

610,"i have used this book for more than 5 years and take it with me on every trip to paris. if you can't get success from these recipes then you might consider some other past time than baking. get used to baking with weights and this book is perfect. something as simple as a madeleinne is created perfectly in weight measures but just a shot in the dark when using volume measurments. this book is not exactly for beginner bakers but if you have some experience it is fantasti
"
1490,"if you are a christian, this book isn't for you. it is full of blashphemy, concluding that we must ""... forgive god"" and that we must love god ""... even if he isnt perfect"". kusher even has the will to say that ""...god would not be god..."" without our love for him. at one point he reduces god to an aminal saying that in the garden of eden, when god said ""...let us make man in our image"" he was speking to animals and creation. kusher explains that god created the world, and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution.

  since when was god in need of forgiveness? isnt it that ""... god so loved the world"" and it wasnt us that loved god? i have no words in describing this book. it is full of error, because it does not base it self on the gospel of jesus christ. all this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner, and that it isnt your fault, and that actully you are a good person. why do bad things happen to good people? wrong question. there are no good people in the world in the first place. "" for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god..."" the world is in sin. the world does not have good people!! only by the grace of god, through faith in jesus christ you are made righteous. i beg you in the name of jesus christ to stay away from this book. it hasnt helped 4 million people, but it lied to them. kusher, please turn from your ways and come to jesus, then will you understand the life question ""why""

1940,"this book is beautifully constructed, concise, gracefully written, and should be of immense help to most golfers.  if you've read ernest jones, percy boomer, or jimmy ballard (for example) and enjoyed the insights but found it difficult to transfer the written word to your swing, try ""the keys ..."": you will read a book that may finally lead you to improve your game.  my swing improved markedly after i came to understand author mcteigue's ""lighthouse turn"" (lesson two: momentum).

1804,"a useful book that provides a good summary comparing differing accounting standards and approaches between countries.  however, it is not worth the price.  it is supposedly written for later year undergraduate and masters accounting students.  it is more suitable for general second year accounting students.  plus, as i am working with a multinational european bank in japan, the book is, rapidly becoming, out of date.  there is none of the simply but incisive commentary which can be found in other books about the differences and outcomes of general accounting principals drawn from different countries

1359,"i just love this book. it's for anyone who practices no particular ""religion"". the prayers are simple, in every day language, easily understood like god is speaking right to me. i find it inspiring every day and look forward to reading one prayer per day. none are more than a few paragraphs and all speak straight to the heart
"
1238,"definitely a wonderful book. for those following the teachings of the other books, this book provides more useful information. the path that castaneda elucidated is fraught with controvery and extreme views (read the other reviews). i found it useful to read and judge for myself. 

what castaneda wrote about is not fiction however it is a difficult path that very few ever advance upon, thus the angry reviews of those  calling castaneda a fraud due to their own failure.  its also a path that those given to fantasy and believing in their own 'specialness' jump on and thus follow blindly with no lasting gains, making up their experience as they go and making sure others hear about it.

definitely not a path for everyone but certainly open to sober verification.  also a great book for those looking for a well written and gripping book.

i believe castaneda's genius as well as his contribution to mankind is yet to be fully appreciated. i am grateful for the gift of his writings and wisdom

"
551,"i will not lash out against anyone, and i will not use specific names of individuals or organizations that replace the search for truth with a situationist relativism based on vainglorious, ostentatious egotism. that said, let me merely point out that the absence of necessary historiographical context makes jesus of nathareth's solutions extremely difficult to accept. first off, it doesn't do us much good to become angry and wave our arms and shout about the evils of jesus's morals in general terms. if we want other people to agree with us and join forces with us, then we must provide a trenchant analysis of jesus's codices. the key point here is that jesus's older analects were deluded enough. his latest ones are undoubtedly beyond the pale. jesus's peuplade appears to be growing in number. i indisputably pray that this is analogous to the flare-up of a candle just before extinction yet i keep reminding myself that jesus has found a way to avoid compliance with government regulations, circumvent any further litigation, and violate his pledge not to condemn innocent people to death -- all by trumping up a phony emergency. his desire to control your bank account, your employment, your personal safety, and your mind is the chief sign that he's a slaphappy caitiff. (the second sign is that jesus feels obliged to force me to undergo ""treatment"" to cure my ""problem"".) 

perhaps i'm reading too much into jesus's ravings, but they don't seem to serve any purpose other than to destroy the natural beauty of our parks and forests. jesus's précis are pyrrhonism cloaked in the rhetoric of truculent, noxious feudalism. that's pretty transparent. what's not so transparent is the answer to the following question: does jesus's oversized ego demand that he condone illegal activities? a clue might be that every time he tries, jesus gets increasingly successful in his attempts to have a serious destabilizing effect on our institutions. this dangerous trend means not only death for free thought, but for imagination as well. 

jesus's eccentricity is surpassed only by his vanity. and his vanity is surpassed only by his empty theorizing. (remember his theory that the cure for evil is more evil?) jesus of nathareth has an agenda -- a political, social, and cultural agenda. and that's all i have to say.

"
1121,"i found this book very helpful in outlining the importance of research &amp; of tracking earnings estimates. mitch zacks gives a good overview of what the key factors are in determining whether a stock will perform. the zacks rank was also interesting as it looks like it has performed very well over the past years...it seems as if the zacks rank really is accurate, and more imporartantly a successful investing method...this is the first book i have read that has actually helped  me make money, rather than just provide broad based market overviews one sometimes reads. overall good book, i would definitely recommend it

1848,"this book is a very good resource for parents of underachievers, former underachievers, and anyone who wants to understand the success of their child. having read other reviews by readers discounting this book and discounting human psychology itself, i was compelled to write my own review. no one blames parents, especially dr. rathvon they do the best they can with what they've got; mental resources specifically. this book is for anyone who knows that their child is capable of so much more. it is never too late to fix, polish, and fine tune a learning mind. every student has the ability to achieve

1180,"i have read all of the karen rose books and i continue to love every one of them.  the other reviews go into great depth explaining the plot so i won't.  the best review i can give an author is when i can honestly say ""i can't put it down!""  when i fall asleep at work due to reading all night i can tell you it was a karen rose book.  ""nothing to fear"" did not diappoint me yet thrilled me with more suspense and visual images than most of karens books.  

i honestly can say that i wish she wrote 10 times faster so i wouldn't have to wait so long for another book to get published.  when i meet a friend or stranger reading romance i can't help but recommend a karen rose book.  this is my latest favorite of hers.  keep writing karen!

480,"native tongue 
by carl hiaasen 

this book is fast paced, has a lot of energy, and a zany weirdness.  no doubt, it is a page-turner.  and it is better than the other book of hiaasen's i have read, double whammy.  but all that does not a good read make...

a strength of hiaasen's books are his characters, well defined and numerous.  most are straightforward stereotypes, from the out-of-luck journalist-turned-publicist, the vapid sex-phone girlfriend, a steroid-doped strongman, the crude-and-sleazy millionaire bad-guy, a muscular-but-clear-minded black good-guy cop, to the dumb-but-intrinsically good-guy burglars, and loads of redneck florida ""crackers"".  hiaasen makes this cast interesting by having them jump through zany hoops, and by casting two characters that are quite original, an environmentally-militant 70+ aged woman, and an environmentally-crazed former-governor-gone-wildman.  and we meet psychotic whales and sex-starved dolphins.  etc. etc.

so what's wrong.  mainly, it's that the book stays at a level of tv-sitcom-gone-book.  it achieves zero depth in dealing with any subject.  one might think that the exception is the environment, but the story is so inane that it cannot achieve traction even here.  so perhaps native tongue is just pure entertainment?  if you like brainless action, gratuitous violence, gross humor, and zany ""fun"", native tongue might satisfy.  

i have one additional problem with hiassen, and it's similar to the problem i so often have with michael crichton.  these books stink of hypocrisy.  crichton makes a (seriously good) living off nifty science ideas while constantly bashing that same science.  hiassen's heroes work hard to rise out of the trash heap of modern society, but hiaasen's writing routinely wallows in that same trash heap for supposed laughs and zaniness. 

while i enjoyed a few sections of native tongue, i had no doubts at the end that i had wasted many hours that should have been better spent
"
1746,"sorry. i hate to pile on, but i must agree with lit teacher on this one. the thinking was sloppy and contradictory, and the writing was wooden, stiff, irritating. i bought it a few months back and hid it in a drawer until i could get around to it. i pulled it out today with a smile and high hopes.  

boy was i disappointed. i thought maybe i was having a bad day. maybe my concentration was off. so i pulled out truman capote. smooth as silk. so it wasn't my fault. it was ron's. i finally decided to scan the book, and that revealed there was really nothing new here, nothing interesting. 

i wish i had not wasted the money. i must be more careful. but, as for this book, there is nothing i need to refer to later, so i'm putting it in the trash. it is saturday evening. they will come on monday to take it and the other garbage away.

1763,"yay--this book was fun and extremely informative.  at first, the idea of coloring at my age was a bit funny (to keep it humorous for me, i conjured up in my mind a tall, overgrown middle-aged male graduate student squeezed in a chair, hunched back looking over a desk and coloring with his set of 64 crayons).  anyway, i digress.  as a doctoral graduate student taking a neuroscience course--this book really helped me nail down structures of *way* too many things.  but ultimately, it helped me make the grade.  if you get the book, make sure to color in it--it really does help (not to mention a great way to relieve some stress from the day).  otherwise, what's the use of buying a book like this--it becomes an ordinary textbook if you don't color in it.

1150,"i read this book for a book report, and because i could not choose another one i could not stop reading it. because i was forced to read this book i now have the knoledge and misfortune of this pathetically boring story. the steriotypical characters hurried through the story full of excuses. 1 star for one very boring book

1264,"it's a bad idea to create a character-driven sci-fi when your characters are this annoying.  the majority of children of the mind consists of inane dialogue between characters that are impossible to care about.  the characters are so one-dimensional and predictable that you already know what they'll say before they say it.  peter says nothing except smart alecky remarks, val spends the whole book whining loudly about not being a real person, novinha is as crazy and hard-headed as she's been for the last two books, and ender spouts off a bunch of trite, up-with-people garbage every chance he gets.  somehow, card even managed to make jane more irritating than my ex-girlfriend during pms.  the only decent characters in this book are miro and wang mu, and they aren't nearly enough to save the story.

i admit it: i only made it a little over half-way through children of the mind.  i couldn't take the dialogue anymore.  that's not to mention the ridiculous plot, which centers on two children warping around the universe, engaging in philosophical discussions with caricatures of japanese and polynesian culture, in an attempt to avert a war between species.

if you're that curious to learn how the ender quartet concludes, do what i should've done from the beginning: find a plot synopsis somewhere and save yourself the pain of reading this garbage
"
1917,"i have read every hiaasen novel, except ""flush"" and ""naked came the manatee."" i have enjoyed reading almost every one of them [there are exceptions -- ""basket case"" definitely was not up to the mark, imho]. the best among them, in my opinion, are  ""strip tease"", and ""double whammy."" ""double whammy"" is funnier among the two. ""strip tease"" is a little more serious.

this is one novel i read once in a while whenever i get the urge to laugh out loud. those characters are crazy
"
868,"it doesn't sound like the people you list as reasons ""not"" to read this book, actually read ""this"" book. there is a big difference, in my opinion, of putting positive affirmations in your mind, versus a witch doctor. and quite honestly, it seems the positive affirmations could and should be used in ""conjuction"" with medical care. does it say anywhere in the book to forego medical care, because you will most definitely be healed? no where. so in my opinion, one has to have a ""sound"" mind, and not view the book as a ""cure all"" for all the ills in life, but rather a positive way to ""enhance"" your life. it is just plain stupid to to avoid getting medical care, when you have a terminal illness, or any other illness for that matter. but according to what i gather from the book, you can use positive affirmations, and ""believe"" that you are getting well, to help keep yourself in a positive state, rather than filling your head with negative thinking that you will never get well. studies aside from this book have proven that a healthy and positive attitude and mental outlook, have done wonders for recovering patients, along with their medical care. your review did not address any of those people that read this book, because the two examples of people you list, it is apparent they didn't read the book either, (not sure what compelled you to post here?) therefore you are not qualified, in my opinion, to critique this book, as they were using apparently some form of faith healing from a televangelist, did they prescribe drinking snakes blood, too? anyway, this book in no way says to forgo medical treatment if you are sick, and those that do, probably won't be addressing their medical problem. can the positive affirmations and power of suggestion help you through your medical crisis? i imagine it can, (studies prove it can) in addition to proper medical treatment. anyway, you might want to actually read the book, instead of making comments of what happened to ""so and so"" who didn't even read it or apply it, including yourself.

1721,"this book is awful.  i have read the entire thing, and it says nothing that is useful.  i have been in public accounting for 10 years, and i am now ready to start my own firm.  i wasted my money on buying this book.  i know it is tempting to buy, since the title is exactly what i was looking for, but trust me, choose another book.  the accounting guild website that the author constantly refers to is no longer in existence

467,"this book has been golden for two of my undergrad communications classes and is turning out an invalvuable reference for my graduate level comm class, which the professor is teaching from a variety of books. it is very easy to understand and the best part is it covers all the rigorous math. it could be more rigorous with the math in some cases. still it is such a broad and complete coverage of all important topics it will serve as your comm encyclopedia.

304,"this is one of the dullest chick lit derivatives of the ya-ya sisterhood and their adventures, or misadventures. it is full of misery, poorly developed characters, and is so formulaic that i predicted the outcome after about 50 pages, at which point i could no longer stomach these ego-driven, falsely sweet dolts. don't waste your money
"
1073,"reading through john irving's ""the cider house rules,"" i found myself continuing to read mostly out of a desire to have the book over and done with and only partly out of a sense of curiosity. in obtaining a bachelor's degree in english, i had to read a lot of books. among them were many books that i did not like, but never before had i read a book that was so completely devoid of subtlety. 

every single scene in the book feels as though it was specifically designed and manufactured by the author to move the plot along. people become pregnant, have abortions, and die with such terrible regularity that you can foresee it dozens of pages before it happens. this goes way beyond mere foreshadowing. the book doesn't flow naturally, you can virtually see the author hiding in the shadows, playing the puppet master. there are just so many coincidences, so many old friends just happening to run into eachother, so many people becoming pregnant just at the exact time to make the story progress perfectly, all of the characters vaguely, distantly connected to eachother. i don't want to spoil the plot, but suffice it to say that the plotline involving the eames (rhymes with screams) family is just too much coincidence to bear. it's as though the author is god, and the characters completely lack free will.

and then there's the ""protagonist,"" homer wells. i put protagonist in quotations because despite being the center of the story, homer wells barely does anything in the story. he barely even speaks during the story. he is virtually a non-character, devoid of personality or will, around whom the other characters and events of the book revolve. the scenes that do not involve homer wells at all, and they make up the majority of the book, are without fail the most interesting scenes. i think that the real protagonist of the book is dr. larch, but even melony seems more real than homer does. 

the story is very long and rambling. subplots are begun and then abandoned and only mentioned in passing much later on. minor characters keep popping into the story, then disappearing, only to pop back into the story exactly when they're needed. conflicts are either quickly and conveniently resolved or simply ignored and forgotten (like the situation with debra pettigrew). 

after such a rambling, at times rather boring plot, the ending feels rather rushed. it is as though the author realized that he suddenly had to resolve everything, tie up every loose end, in the last 25 pages (and tying up loose ends, in this case, means a lot of people conveniently dying). to spoil the plot just a little, homer wells, who has throughout the book been opposed to abortion because he feels that a fetus has a soul, suddenly and inexplicably and completely reverses on this opinion. i personally am pro-choice as well, but i found that homer's sudden reversal was completely contrary to his character and caused the ending of the book to collapse into a bunch of nonsensical happily-ever-afters
"
978,"this book is very revealing to the reader of the special aspect of being a christian, which is being a dispenser as well as a receiver of grace.  so much of the christianity portrayed today is the exact opposite.  we see more often the christian faith portrayed as a religious form, political arm, and unloving attitude.  this book is a real insight into the christian faith  of how to be a true follower of christ who cared so much about individuals, especially those who were not self righteous, but fallen and in need of grace to restore their lives. 
"
1958,"this is one of the finest popular histories i have ever read.  whether it is a book about 5th and 6th century british history using arthur as a organizing principle, or a book about the ""real"" arthur using 5th and 6th century history as a backdrop, this book is wholly convincing concerning the reality of arthur and the historical context in which he lived.  the book may actually be too good.  the most convincing evidence it cites -- the so-called british easter annals -- appear  to have been called into question by subsequent scholarship; and the link between arthur and mount badon is not quite as convicing as it seeme to be when alcock wrote the book.  in short, this masterpiece needs updating.  but a masterpiece it is.  no one who reads this book with any care can fail to come away from it without a vastly improved understanding not only of the british dark ages, but of the nature of historical evidence, scholarship, and truth.  this is a great book
"
902,"i did not finish the book (i got about 70% of the way through before i realized i could not bear to read one more page).  maybe the remaining part of the book would have been better, but i doubt it.  this is the first time i can ever remember not even having even the slightest interesting in finishing a book.  the characters were flat and plot went nowhere.  please - there are million of books out there.  spare yourself, and find something else to read. anything.
"
1535,"no intellectual can afford to be unacquainted with the immortal john dewey and his ""experimental school."" who would dare criticize the education legend inseparably linked with the irreproachable rhetoric of ""progressivism?"" i would.

dewey's conception of the child as learner assumes that the uneducated mind is essentially capable of directing its own knowledge by a spontaneous inquisitiveness stemming  from nature study. this he then expects to blossom into a more expanded consideration of the various academic subjects with the teacher merely facilitating transitions and answering the child's self-posed questions. the problems in dewey's model begin with his science fair-meets-museum-meets-playground-meets-lecture hall school design: the model is untested on any large scale and the cost plus upkeep is prohibitively expensive. classes are small and require several specialists and non-reusable materials. as if kids didn't have enough problems with the basic skills set already, dewey would have them heavily involved in shop and home economics. even more outrageous in dewey's model is the premise that we ought never force students to study what they do not like. their own intellectual prejudices reign supreme and by implication, teachers are discouraged from evaluating against solid standards. experienced teachers know that kids can easily hide their shortcomings even when required to study their weak subjects, and that remediation is hard to implement before they slip further behind. how could dewey's recommendation to cater almost exclusively to the child's intrinsic likes not further disguise and exacerbate low performance?

deweyism of course, like many other off-the-wall theories of education, denies behaviorism when it refuses to acknowledge psychological patterns in man. it depicts formulaic teaching and learning as fundamentally faulty and generalized curricula as harmful to student individuality. nothing could less representative of the quality research conducted, particularly project follow through: the great skeleton in the student-centered advocates' closet. i'd personally like to see dewey's updated plan for seamlessly moving kids, who come into class with their ""natural inquisitiveness"" programmed by tv, rap music, and other pop media, into colonial american history, calculations of hyperbolic asymptotes, tennessee williams, and the ""plus-que-parfait"" tense. but of course, such leaps of interest are unnecessary if we utterly throw out the old-fashioned academic corpus along with the old-fashioned school system.

90% of students in high schools today report that they do not feel adequately challenged. maybe the answer doesn't lie in yielding to children's lack of intellectual discipline but in tapping their potential to control that uninformed caprice. dewey's ""progressivism"" relies upon the contradiction of allowing uneducated mind educate the teacher on its own education. from the absurdity of it, i can only conclude that sane people latch onto this school gedankenexperiment to maintain an escapist fantasy in light of dismally high drop-out rates, lowered standards, and social discord. but a radical solution is not necessarily synonymous with a good one
"
819,"this book is terribly organized.  i'm not sure what happened in writing this book, but it seems clear that professor jones did not compile this in the chronological order that it is printed in.

my main complaint is that rather obscure concepts/people/events are repeatedly referred to, and then only later does jones bother to define them.  (i would almost prefer that he not define something at all, rather than offering a definition 100 pages after his first reference to it!)  the fact that the book has an index only further infuriated me - clearly the author/publisher knew where all these terms were located throughout the book, yet did not bother to offer a definition in the appropriate/first reference to the concept.

examples are numerous, but here are a few:
**robe nobility: referenced on pages 139, 152, 183.  defined? (pg. 183)
**sans culottes: first referenced on page 189, defined on page 231.
**louis-sebastien mercier: referenced on pages 11, 138, 178, 189, 200, 204, 212, 213.  when did jones provide information (that he was a ""journalist, dramatist and observer of parisian mores"") on just who mercier is?  page 215.

aside from that, there are some plain old errors.  one such is in the text box on saint genevieve.  jones mentions that she negotiated with frankish military chieftains in the 570s and 580s.  she died in 512ad, so the negotiations seem improbable.  (470s & 480s would be correct, but i should not have to figure that out.)

1205,"i'm on page 110 of this book. the book has 220 pages. i'm half way done and the author has not as of yet given me 1 valuable peace of information to help me forgive the person i am angry with. i bought this book because i have a lot of anger in me and the preface and reviews from other well know authors sold me on it with the belief that this book would help me. but, it is having the opposite affect. i feel i was duped into buying it (because of the promises in the introduction and the glowing reviews). part 1 tells us what a ""grievance"" is. it tells us, and tells us again, and again, and again. the thing is  i already know what a grievance is! i know i'm angry at someone, and i know it's not healthy, i know to forgive would help me.... i didn't need that to be explained to me over and over again for 59 pages. all that reading did was make me dwell and think more about the problem and increased my anger because of the book itself. when i reached ""part 2"", entitles ""forgiveness"" i thought finally.... but all part 2 has done is repeat what is in part 1 and what is in the introduction - how great the study was and how much it will help me. there are some great reviews of this book here at amazon and if this book helped some people that is great. but so far i can't agree with any of the positive comments. i have a great degree of respect for stanford university, i went to high school across the street from stanford and have taken classes there, but it pains me to have such a great school's name attached to this book. is it fair of me to write a review of a book i have not finished? no... but i'm afraid to continue reading it. i'm already angry and to buy a book that i thought would help me, only to find it frustrating me, i don't feel is not all that fair either......

1393,"roman, by roman polanski is a very good book.  it is very touching about his memories of his late wife, sharon tate and their short life together.  roman lost his wife and unborn child in 1969 by the manson group.  he had a  very hard life in poland during wwii.  he lost both his parents during that  time, but he grew up to be a world famous director.  the book tells about  his struggles during these times, and also during the period after the  deaths of his wife and child.  he tells about his hollywood days of  directing, his famous friends, famous people and then what turned out to be  his downfall...with the teenaged girl acusing him of sexual contact and him  being arrested.  to avoid persecution, roman left the united states and has  been in exile in france ever since, but still directs and has released more  movies.   but, the book is very well told, and gives a good insite on  roman's life and his career

322,"never be sick again offers a major breakthrough in medical thinking regarding health and disease.  i am a biochemist doing medical research at ucla. a friend gave me this book to read, and i was very skeptical.  after reading it, i couldn't stop thinking about what it was saying.  i even lost sleep thinking about it.  after many weeks, i have come to a conclusion - the author is right.  there is only one disease and there are only two causes of disease - revolutionary!  once you understand this simple concept, it changes everything.  if your mind is not closed to new ideas, the profound insights in this book will change your life for the better.  it will give you the power to both prevent and reverse almost all disease.  with this new understanding, from now on, i will approach my research in an entirely different way.

1218,"i am a huge thomas hardy fan, and i was not disappointed with this book. at first all the technical astronomical information was slow, but the love story started and that was forgotten. my only complaint about two on a tower is the ending. it seems very rushed - everything comes crashing together in about 10 pages. it wasn't realistic for viviette to age so much and no longer be beautiful 4 years later, considering she was only 33 at the end of the story. sir constantine was possessive, jealous and terrifying but she still kept her health and beauty after suffering with him. the bishop was full of himself - how is that worse? a few years with him and all of a sudden she's an old woman with a heart condition? swithin comes back and says he'll marry her, she's overcome with joy and boom! she dies in his arms. i also find it strange that neither swithin or viviette acknowledged that the boy was his. didn't people in the village realize who he looked like, since people were already suspicious of the lovers? what will happen next, swithin takes his son in and marries tabitha lark? a very good, sad, complicated romance

1910,"""the climb"" was written by bourkeev and dewalt as an answer to krakaur's ""into thin air"". while not showcasing the same prose as krakaur's book, i feel that this is utlamitely better. my reasoning for this opinion is that ""the climb"" seems like a much more fair and unbiased account. bourkeev does not resort to playing the blame game; he simply tells the story as he experienced it. krakaur, it seemed to me at least, relied to heavily on assumptions, and we all now what happens when you assume (hint: you make an _____ out of you and me) and came off as very arrogant and (for some reason) took a feverious dislike to bourkeev and lopsang. thought not as well written as ""into thin air"", ""the climb"" still managed to draw me in fully, although some parts of the book are a little confusing, mainly the interview with bourkeev about his single handed rescue of three striken climbers who otherwise would have surely perieshed. this interview was conducted in english, the only problem with that is that bourkeev's english is not very strong! it is passable and most of the time you can understand him but in other parts it is very hard to dechyper. dewalt tries to help by adding ""translations"" about what bourkeev is saying but i felt the interview should have been caried out in bourkeev's native tongue of russian and then translated into english. to not have done this is a great injustice to bourkeev. if you want to read a fair and unbiased book about the may 1996 everest tragidy that was written simply to tell the truth and not to play smeer tatics and make money (as krakaur's clearly was), read this. i really recommend you read both books, though and also check out the imax movie ""everest"".

1817,"how can a best-selling author like simon winchester take an event as exciting as the san francisco earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze-fest? one answer: write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases. another: strive to break the record for most clich?s in a single paragraph. finally: write about events in 1906 as if no one but simon winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus, everything in this tedious narrative becomes about simon. simon and the raccoons; simon on the failing american economy; simon attempting to reproduce american accents. this is a cd set for avoiding

"
131,"updike failed to hold my attention throughout the story both because of its utter lack of suspense in any dimension and the inconsistencies in his character development.

as other have stated, you know from page one that the final page will involve an arab, a truck and a bomb.  the lack of anticpation must therefore be compensated for by something else - perhaps excellent writing, interesting character development or original insights.  updike fails to deliver on all three counts.

one particularly slipshod literary technique updike uses is the phrasing he gives the title character ahmad.  when ahmad speaks, it is in the voice of an intelligent, thoughtful foreigner.  his phrasing captures very well the cadence, vocabulary and grammar of a well spoken non-native speaker of english.  curiously, ahmad is an american, raised in new jersey by a thoroughly american mother.  so, what influences created this stilted phrasing?  updike is trying to somehow comvince us that a jersey teenager speaks like a pakistani or egyptian immigrant.  there is no need for the technique and its inconsistency with the character's life is grating.

updike also relies heavily on ethnic/religious stereotypes.  sterotypes often have some basis in fact but generally make for uninteresting literature.  however, in updike's case, the stereotypes make little sense at all.  for instance, a high school counselor's entire personality is attributed to his ""jewishness"" both by himself and by others who opine on his personality.  this is particularly curious given that the man was not raised as a jew and, in fact, his family had rather adamently turned away from the religion two generations earlier.  so where does all the jewsih influence come from?  likewise, ahmad's mother's personality is often linked to her irish heritage.  yet there is no evidence whatsoever that her irish background (which could have been many generations ago) has influenced her one bit.  the reader is left once again to wonder what motivates the stereotype - other than simply poor writing and careless character development.

another out of place literay technique involves the inclusion of fairly lengthy passages from the korna in arabic.  obviously, few western readers will understand arabic and it seems meerely pretensious for updike to include the original language rather than paraphrasing or translating the passages.  what comes across is an attempt by the autohr to show he has done his research.  if that is truly the point then the reader must wonder why the passages are reproduced in western script rather than arabic script.  after all, the koran is not written with western phonetics in mind.
ultimately, the book leaves one wondering why such a lightweight, poorly constructed piece was released by such a skilled author

1821,"the literature of september 11 is never attacked.  when a book speaks of september 11 (or of terrorism in general), it is more or less guaranteed immunity from criticism; it will almost inescapably be greeted with sympathy.  jonathan safran foer's extremely loud and incredibly close banks on such sympathy, on such reverence.  the narrative, which concerns a nine-year-old boy named oskar schell in search of a key that would unlock / unshell the enigma of his dead father (a narrative stolen, in its basic outline, from guenther grass's die blechtrommel), could have been written entirely without its scattered references to the terrorist interventions.  nor is this trauma the only one presented in the novel: the others include hiroshima / nagasaki, the staten island ferry crash, and the dresden bombings.  each disaster is generalized to the point at which what is addressed is not a traumatizing event in its specificity, but historical ""trauma"" itself and the overcoming of trauma through bereavement-inspired creation.  oskar, the insufferable brat, attempts to complete the work of mourning for his father, thomas schell, jr., a victim of september 11, by compiling an almanac of self-inflicted wounds, the collage of images and letters which is the book we are ""reading""---an almanac which, most likely, is written sometime in the indefinite future (thomas shell, sr.'s manuscript of 4/12/78 is heavily edited (pp. 208-216).  who has done the editing?  almost certainly an older version of his grandson oskar).  if the term, ""reading"" even applies.  whenever a ""pregnant"" image is described, foer literally re-presents it in the form of a pictorial image.  when a flock of birds rises into the sky, it is not enough that we read of these birds---we must see them as well.  words may not be left in their invisibility; we are presented with supplementary photographs, illustrations, since mere verbality is not enough.  (indeed, the entire novel oozes with misologos --- the mistrust or hatred of language --- in terms of both its content and its form.)  photographs, yes, and also a superabundance of blank pages and nearly blank pages.  space is not used in the manner it is in the works of edmond jabes, for instance.  typography does not substitute for a well-wrought sentence.  foer abrogates himself of all responsibilities --- most specifically, the responsibility to write well.  why bother when the pyrotechnics of typography are at his disposal?  as far as the writing is concerned, it is composed of nothing other than mind-numbingly, soul-deadeningly repetitive phrases (""heavy boots,"" ""raison d'etre,"" etc.) and sunday school platitudes: ""sometimes one simply wants to disappear"" (184); ""there's nothing wrong with not understanding yourself"" (184); ""everything that's born has to die, which means our lives are like skyscrapers"" (245); ""how can you say i love you to someone you love?...  it's always necessary"" (314).  whenever the author writes something that he finds ""beautiful"" and ""true"" (165), he congratulates himself on his brilliance and tells us that that thing is ""beautiful"" and ""true.""  the entire book reeks of such unearned profundity.  we also learn that most dust is made up of human detritus---a very deep truth indeed, one that foer also communicates in his essay, ""emptiness"" (originally published in playboy) with all of the sanctimoniousness and self-righteousness of the faux naif who serves as the center of the novel, a sunday school lecture in which we learn that famous musicians (ringo star) and scientists (stephen hawking) are unthreateningly approachable: everything is familiarized.  perhaps it is wrong to criticize foer for including so many blank pages in extremely loud and incredibly close, since the entire book is a vacuum: null space into which readers may project their own meanings.

1,"this very fascinating book is a story written in the form of numerous letters and personal diary entries made by the principle character of the book.  it chronicals the life of a young scottish woman forced to live first in china then japan.  well written and historically accurate, it's obvious the author is intimately familiar with the the culture, customs, history and life style of japan.  this makes the book that much more interesting and fascinating for those who enjoy realism and demand accuracy in a story.  for all who've ever lived in japan, it's a believable tale that literally makes you feel you've stepped back in a time machine to witness the birth of modern japan.  for those who haven't lived in japan, believe that the author has done his homework and is not simply just creating a fictional setting in his mind.  because of this, he's able to focus on his character versus scene/setting development and thus creates a living breathing person in your mind.  the timespan covers over 40 years as the story weaves through her trials and tribulations, and shows how her fortitude and strength serve her through tumultuous events in her life.  a gripping tale that draws on your emotions and has you constantly rooting for her.  when the last page is read it leaves you wishing the story would continue, but even good books must end.  be prepared to sit a spell.  once you start reading you'll find it hard to put down

918,"steven pinker has written a fascinating account of how language works; how we, as listeners, process the sounds that make up words and sentences in a way that allows us to extract meaning. the book is clear, entertaining and very accessible; pinker's writing style is witty and engaging.

my appreciation of the book is not only as a reader and enthusiast of language, but also as a writer; despite having been writing for years, and having studied numerous books on writing style and technique, it is ""the language instinct"" that positively impacted my writing more than anything else that i've read; an understanding (at least a partial one - i'm no expert) of the way your words will be parsed by the brain of your reader can be very valuable in one's attempt to write clearly and well.

i highly, highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning something new, and being entertained in the process.

"
917,"rewind to 1992. it's the dawn of the so-called information & knowledge age. back then, i wrote a book on the need to liberate and effectively channel the creativity of all employees in an organization. the rationale: to create higher performing organizations in a time of intense global competition. with pressing needs for superior innovation. and improved productivity. amid ever-leaner budgets. (sound familiar?)

flash forward a dozen years to today and ideas are free (a title echoing phil crosby's classic quality is free). 

this new book makes clear today that my impassioned plea from a decade ago failed to eradicate idea-stifling organizational cultures. way too many work places, it seems, still quell expressions of innovative thinking by both frontline employees and middle managers. 

so the case for turning on the innovation spigot needs to be made again with renewed vigor. in answering that call, professors robinson & schroeder offer some worthwhile and occasionally surprising and compelling contributions to this topic that is as relevant now as ever.

ideas are free presents an articulate case that organizations -- and individual managers -- need to unleash the *still* largely untapped brainpower intentionally and quite unfortunately held-back by employees. 

three elements make ideas are free especially worthy of your time and money.

1. the authors aim their advice at regular workaday managers. sure, they rightfully point out how organizational systems are often ""dysfunctional."" and they make the case that many corporate practices actually *discourage* creative contributions by individuals even as they try to *incent* those very behaviors. but robinson & schroeder don't aim their prescriptions at policy-making top executives only. many chapters conclude with what the authors term ""guerilla tactics"" -- clear directives for simple actions that even frontline supervisors can put to work ""without the boss's permission."" 

2. the book dramatically makes the case that paying for ideas -- as part of an organization's formal suggestion systems -- is fraught with potential negative side-effects. my own corporate experience as an executive championing a newly installed suggestion system bears out the startling reality that this well-intentioned process can turn into a self-destructive minefield. (and, let the record show, i largely missed this dimension in covering suggestion systems back in my '92 work.)

3. many interesting, well-developed (albeit occasionally dated) anecdotes illustrate the book's sound principles. they help make ideas are free a grounded, engaging, and palatable read.

back in '92, i suggested in my book mavericks! that, ""managers should be asking questions like: what is the value of a useful new idea? if one good idea leads to another, where could thousands and thousands lead us? what is the cost to the organization for not tapping the endlessly renewable resource of ideas in our employees' heads?"" 

getting to the root of the problem, i asked: ""isn't the job of a manager to *recognize and choose* from lots of great ideas generated by fellow work associates?"" and answered: ""unfortunately, most managers -- even those who claim they invite suggestions from their people -- subscribe to the time-honored myth that a manager's job is to *have* the ideas.""

in 2004, robinson & schroeder again plow many of these very same themes (and cite data that also have been around for a long time). still, this book explores afresh the opportunities that arise from drawing out the best thinking of every employee. and it presents realistic tactics that all managers can deploy to effectively deal with these still-critical issues.

wherever you sit in the hierarchy, read ideas are free to seize powerful ideas about potential gains for your organization's progress and prosperity.

1854,"firstly, let me say the research nicholas lardy has conducted is commendable and a welcome addition to the existing literature. his data sources are vast and highly informative.  the major limitation of this  publication is that the central argument is biased. lardy selects those  data and pieces of existing literature which support his own view. as a  result, major sections of the literature concerning financial reform in  transitional economies are simply ignored or brushed over.  lardy's view is  the typical western, dare i say &quot;american&quot; argument. primarily he  uses financial criteria to evaluate the economic performance of china's  state banks. this methodoloy is extremely poor - particularly in the  context of china's trannsitional economy. financial criteria are a horrible  guide to both internal and allocative economic efficiency. if anyone would  like elaboration on this point feel free to email me.  in summary, lardy's  book is informative and makes for interesting reading. however as a piece  of economic analysis, its usefulness is limited. the major reason for this  is a total lack of economic theory(as indicated by the previous reviewer)  which has resulted in a poor methodology

533,"the snow goose is a beautifully written book that lingers in the memory long after the hour or so that it takes to read.  set on the coast of england at the time of dunkirk, it is less about the strife of wwii itself than about its three main characters - one of whom is the snow goose - and what binds them.  it is a story about nature, love, and nobility of spirit.  to say more would be to give too much away.  but it has had a place on my bookshelf for decades, and i reread it when i need to be reminded what is important in life

461,"ms wilson needs to make up her mind whether to write a book of literary criticism or a biography.  the book suffers from too much critical analysis of sassoon's poetry and not enough about his life.  either he was an extremely boring and prosaic poet or ms. wilson needs to delve deeper into his intellectual and emotional development - really his cricket exploits and his hunting prowess does not lend anything to the very essence of his life.  ms. wilson's prose is turgid and repetitive. an extremely disappointing work
"
176,"his basic thesis is that a liberal empire can be a greatly positive force in the world, and that the united states is already an empire, but that our inablility to acknowledge the fact leads us to waste our opportunities to be the afore mentioned positive force. ferguson writes that america is plagued by an attention deficit disorder and too much love of the good life. thus, we get distracted too easily from important events overseas, and when we do try to intervene, we want quick fixes and low costs.

i couldn't agree more with most of these points. as an american, i'm greatly ashamed of our collective ignorance. i hate feeling like a foreigner in my our country because i watch the news or can find sumatra on a map. also, the book strikes a chord with me because of my frustration with half measures in foreign interventions. countless times, i believe america has done more harm than good by, if you will, talking the talk but not walking the walk. if we commit to something, we need to follow through. this is as true in iraq today as it has been in the past. we've claimed to support democracy in latin america, but then turned bannana republics into bannana autocracies. we greatly prolonged and increased vietnam's suffering without changing the end result at all.

with all this commonality, however, there are a few leaps of logic that ferguson makes that i can't bring myself to agree with. basically, he didn't sell me on the thought that the imperial model is the best way to develop the world. how are we supposed to know what is best for everyone? won't our own biases and self interests inevitably distort even our most altruistic efforts?

when ferguson hold's up the british empire as a model of success, i can't help but notice that the best results came only to those places of british colonization, with horrendous consequences for each of the native populations there. and the two greatest examples of beneficial american imperialism - japan and germany - were already highly developed before world war ii, so it probably wasn't that much of a wonder that we were able to help them return to such a state.

even if the positive power of empire is conceded, there are important differences between the state of world during the british empire and the state of the world now. it's a concern of immunity from repercussions. in the golden age of imperialism, europe was in a kind of splendid isolation from its empires. not to say that there were no reprercussions, but, with the only modern navies in the world, europe was immune to any very serious threats. on the other hand, in today's world, as an effect of globalization, power has become more decentralized in some respects. think wmds,terrorists, and foreign investments in the u.s. economy, for example. can america as easily afford to make enemies in the developing world as the british could?

in the end ""colossus"" didn't settle any agruments for me, but raised new and interesting questions. it is a book that makes you think, and that in and of itself is worth four stars.

""roots"" and ""beloved"" are historic, well-documented treasures and need to be used in educating all children no matter race, creed or color.  to make sure what i read had some semblance of truth while in puerto rico i visited a sugar mill in guanica and my heart just melted.  if you read the book you will understand my feelings.  i became angry because something as simple as not being forthwith with documented history such as this to young minds of american children lead to misunderstandings amongst the masses hailing from africa, south america, the caribbean, asia, united states and europe.  eric williams i know i can not thank you in person because you are no longer here physically but your spirit lives on in your books and you will always be alive everytime one more person reads your book and awaken ""thank you""!  for everyone else read the book it will cleanse your soul and feed your mind.  once you finish this read ""how europe underdeveloped africa"" by the same author

1069,"having been a fan of antonia fraser for many years, i highly anticipated her biography of queen marie-antoinette, but have been very disappointed in that she often chooses the sensational over the factual. she depicts marie-antoinette's mother empress maria theresa as heartless and calculating for sending her daughter to france at age 14 to get married, but arranged marriages were the norm; the empress was not doing anything out of the ordinary. what startled me most is that fraser not only insists on antoinette having an affair with count axel von fersen, of which there is little concrete evidence, but goes onto maintain that axel used condoms to keep the queen from getting pregnant. it seems to me that marie-antoinette loved children so much; she came from a family of sixteen where children were valued and her more liberal sister caroline went on to have eleven children or more. she was also a devout catholic and using such devices were unthinkable, unless one was a prostitute or dealing with prostitutes. in this case fraser is applying the morals of some british aristocratic ladies to a queen of france. if marie-antoinette had been caught in adultery, it would have been considered treason; she would have been sent to a convent and had her children taken away from her. with all of her enemies at court, that was not a risk she would have taken, if she had been so inclined. on a smaller scale, fraser makes ridiculous assertions about marie-antoinette dyeing her hair - in all the pictures that i have seen of her, her hair looks grey from either powder or premature age; i have never read any first hand accounts of her dyeing it. not that that is a big deal; but it makes me wonder where lady fraser's life ends and where marie-antoinette's life begins. i found it offensive that at the end fraser interprets marie-antoinette's death as some kind of sacrifice for the cause of democracy, when she believed in monarchy and wanted her little son to be king. especially, since marie-antoinette's murder was followed not by democracy but by dictatorships and napoleon crowning himslf emperor. sadly, there is a lacuna of decent biographies of the queen in the english language. one can only hope that the works of bertieres, chalon, and delorme will soon be translated and published in english. fraser's book does have some interesting details (aside from those which flow from her imagination) and it is much more sympathetic to the queen than lever's travesty

1841,"this book does what it says. it lists low or no cost campgrounds, they may not be where you want to go or fit your mega motorhome, that's what commercial parks are for. i don't know if it is all-inclusive but it certainly has most of the campgrounds that i know of in areas in which i am familiar

1438,"though the concept of sharing real life problems experienced during pregnancy is a great one, the author is extremely biased toward hospital birth managed by obs. 

at one point, the author actually defends episiotomies... she seems to blindly accept every procedure her physician pushes upon her, and she looks at him as being responcible for the outcome of her birth. it was both infuriating and saddening.

if you are looking for a book to make you laugh a little, this is cute. if you are looking for a book that might actually aid or assist you in making informed choices concerning your pregnancy or birth, this is not for you!

735,"i read this book on a suggestion from a friend, before i read ""reviving ophelia"", because she wanted to see if i would be as dissapointed with it as she was. i was more so. while there are some outstanding essays in this collection, the bias of the editor clearly stands out. there is no one for the outcasts to relate to. there was no musician, nor was there anyone that dealt with an alternative religion. there were no essays from people who had a different relationship with their parents than she had. the sections are poorly named and divided. all in all, it is an unworthy book to be associated with the original. some girls it may ""make feel less alone"", but for me it only accentuated the differences. definately take out from the library before you buy it

965,"this book provides excellent information about what rheumatoid arthritis is, how to distinguish it from osteoarthritis, etc.

however, i don't want to live with ra, i want to recover from it. as such, this book offers no help in this regard. it tells me about drugs that i can take and splints that i can wear to help me from becoming completely disabled, but offers me no hope of recovery.

in contrast, the book ""conquering arthritis"" by barbara allan, is the well-researched account of someone who took charge of their health and fought to recover from the disease, to get their life back. and succeeded! i'm well on the road to recovery myself by applying the principles in her book. now that's a book well worth spending your money on

717,"this book written by don brown is a wonderful children's book.  in this story, set in 1870, mary kingsley uses her childhood to motivate her travels to africa. mary begins the story as a child, who is taking care of her ill mother. her father travels a lot, and is rarely home. although mary never attended school she loves to read and uses this to escape. mary, now an adult travels to africa which was a big accomplishment for a woman at that time. the book tells some of her experiences in africa. without revealing what happens at the end, i will tell you that mary has many experiences in this children's book. she takes the reader through her life. the illustrations in the book help the reader visualize mary's life. this is not my favorite children's book, but i would highly recommend this book to any parent or child. it kept my interest and it is sure to keep yours

738,"having recently graduated with a ba in english, i am forever doomed to read such so-called ""truth texts"" with what could only be called an eye for detail; does the author site her sources?  credentials?  any sort of solid evidence as to why i, as her reader, should believe a word of what she says?
the answer is, simply, no.
ms. cumbey quotes other texts by other zealotous fundamentalists, to be sure.  however, the credentials of these people remain a mystery.  anyone can write a book, and anyone with enough money can get it published.  had i the funds, i could write a ""revealing, riveting best seller"" on the nature of human genomes and cloning and my opinions of the matter; throw in a few quotes by people who may or may not sound like they know what they're talking about, and there you go.  the point is, my knowledge of such topics is sorely limited, as is ms. cumbey's research.  yet somehow a book that would never earn a passing grade in a collegiate literature course for lack of research and depth of understanding is littering our shelves.  well, i'm baffled

606,"dragons are certainly among the most quintessential elements of the fantasy genre and their likenesses comprise one of the cornerstones of the art associated with it. dragonart: how to draw fantastic dragons and fantasy creatures is both an enjoyable browse and a useful guide for anyone interested in creating their own dragons or other fantastic creatures with pencil and paper. 

dragonart is divided into three major parts, fantastic dragons, unique details, and other fantasy creatures, along with an introduction, a section on how to use the book, and a brief guide to fantastic creatures. 

lessons in this book are progressive in nature, beginning with fundamentals and moving into increasingly advanced aspects of dragon design, all illustrated with step-by-step illustrations that are punctuated by helpful tips and tricks throughout. and author/artist jessica ""neondragon"" peffer has a clear, easy writing style that can be easily comprehended, absorbed, and acted upon, an example of which follows below. 

""okay, so we're going to discuss the anatomy of a creature that exists nowhere but in our minds. sounds kind of silly to say that something made from pure imagination does not look correct, but that will happen if your creature doesn't look believable. to help make your dragon as real as possible, base its structure on real creatures,"" she writes at one point (page 44). ""the ideal dragon is likely a mix of cat, bird, and reptile body types. the trick is choosing which parts to keep and which ones to throw out. you want it to feel like a single creature."" 

this advice, incidentally, is very reminiscent of that given by leonardo da vinci in his notebooks for drawing creatures of this ilk, making peffer well read or naturally very insightful, either of which speaks well for her. under ""how you should make an imaginary animal look natural,"" the increasingly famous renaissance man writes, ""you know that you cannot invent animals without limbs, each of which, in itself, must resemble those of some other animal. hence if you wish to make an animal, imagined by you, appear natural -- let us say a dragon, take for its head that of a mastiff or hound, with the eyes of a cat, the ears of a porcupine, the nose of a greyhound, the brow of a lion, the temples of an old cock, the neck of a water tortoise."" 

dragonart also includes guidelines on drawing a number of other sorts of fantastic creatures, including basilisks, chimeras, gargoyles, and griffins. 

for those interested in applying the guidelines presented in this book, a companion dragonart kit: how to draw & paint fantastic creatures that includes a compressed version of the book and some art supplies will also be available soon. author peffer is also the creator of the popular fantasy art website neondragonart.com, which can give anyone potentially interested in this book the opportunity to get a sense of the kinds of creatures they can learn to create themselves.

1444,"noam chomsky has thrived greatly in this great country of his, yours, and mine - the united states of america.  he has made millions of dollars teaching, lecturing, selling his books, and investing.  his world-wide fame in psycholinguistics is well-deserved.  his infamy is merited for his lack of loyalty to his own jewish ethnicity and the u.s., in spite of the fruits he has received by being a citizen of the united states.  he has repaid this country in bile with his incredibly biased analysis of american foreign policy.  he goes way beyond a balanced multiculturism, when he always ranks the u.s. and israel as foremost among the terrorist forces in the world now, and even in history.  his distrust of any authority, benign or otherwise, is reflected in his dogmatic and unexamined support of the ""underdog,"" even if that underdog is a suicide bomber or a major terrorist organization such as al queda or hezbollah.  

yet since 1955, hypocrite chomsky has worked for the ""overdog"" massachusetts institute of technology, which has actively and enthusiastically participated in the development of weapons of war and mass destruction, and continues to this very day.

chomsky trumps his own potential for gifted analytic objectivity with his simple hatred of the united states and the jewish state.

if he were not so attached to the freedom of making money, earning the adulation of the american left, and freedom to express himself, he might be able to give more direct and personal support for our enemies and his friends by taking up residence in north korea, iran, or syria.  let us hope he retires outside of our homeland that he hates so much, the united states of america.  

god bless america, which will continue to give chomsky the right to speak, teach, and make lots of money.

"
845,"there are no doubt a few nuggets of wisdom in this book, but they are buried too deeply in bureaucratic gibberish to be worth digging up.  this book has no bibliography, no index, mediocre footnotes, no serious useful conclusions or strategic summary, and a disturbing combination of american-centrism (on page 71: &quot;in the asian continent....(t)he first driver will be the future u.s. role in asia.&quot;) with a lack of intelligent presentation.  there are exactly three figures and seven tables in this 336 page book, when there should have been at least 30 tables and figures illustrating specific sources of conflict in relation to specific countries.  the world conflict and human rights map (8 pages of graphics and 8 pages of fine print) out of leiden university does vastly more to inform than does this book.  this book should never, ever have been published in its present form--i venture to say that if it were condensed to 150 pages and properly edited, with graphics and good synthesis, it might be worthy of a second look.  time is the most precious commodity in the world--rand managers and editors need to get serious about how they present possibly useful information to experts who want to know what rand thinks, but cannot spare the time to get past cumbersome undisiplined--even lazy--preparations.  the topic of this book is extremely important--those who would invest their scarce time and money in doing research in this area deserve better from those who put together this book

9,"i have a hard time understanding what it is that i dislike about the novel. i dislike it almost as much as the movie.
i have been a loyal follower of smiley and some more after that. once the cold war was over, jlc had to look for a new realm. i tried to follow him, but gave up with the kaukasian troubles, forgot the name of the book.
maybe it is this: jlc's trade mark, his usp, is the evilness of the other side. with the kgb & co., that worked perfectly. his readers were willing to stay with him and believe him.
now he is transferring the kgb style to all sorts of other badies. i think it does not work any more.
it is not that i trust the pharmaceutical companies enough to not be like here insinuated. i do not.
what i do not like, i guess, is the artificial mood of intellectual suffering from the evilness of all kind of conspiracies. tess in this story seems to be the normal do-gooder who falls foul with the baddies. that is more ok in the book than in the movie. (there, for my eyes, rachel weisz does herself discredit.)
what is absolutely not ok is the surrender of command by the narrator mid way. jlc gives up on trying to keep a believable storyline and declines into darkest conspiracy allegations

844,"this book is hot!!. i anxiously awaited the next ""grayson"" novel, after reading of course, all, the ""falcon"" and ""grayson"" families' stories. i honestly thought nothing could top luke grayson's romance with catherine. however, ms. ray's story about brandon and faith was just that!!  i hope the next book in the grayson saga is out very soon, because again, i can hardly wait!!  and if you have not read all of francis ray's novels(not just her stories about the graysons and falcons), get to reading... you will not be disappointed. 
"
947,"i found it to lean very heavily towards a hierarchal view of the relationship between men and women.  men are to rule, and women are to submit to that rule.  the authors appear to see women as perpetual children who need to be under the continual domination of men, rather than as adults who deal with men on an adult level.  i suggest anyone who reads this books should also read ""discovering biblical equality.""  it gives another view of how the christians world see the role of women

1040,"the previous review is clear about the value of this translation.  knowing a bit of german, i can say that this translation does use shapes instead of forms for gestalten.  the real value of the work beyond the translation, however, especially for first time readers, is found in the notes made by david luke.  these notes are helpful for the historical context, allusions to goethe's personal life and work, and allusions to philosophy, literature, and more ... all essential to understanding the work

1786,"i am finding this book quite helpful to getting to know myself better and to have greater control over my emotional responses, or mood. the authors guide you through several approaches of specific steps you should take to get to know some of your core beliefs, which they say may be causing depression. you are free to choose the approach that works best for you, but you do need to try them all to see what works. it is quite time consuming. one of the approaches requires you to record your activities and asses your mood every hour. the instructions are clear and concice and examples provided are helpful, however it does take a true commitment. i suppose it may be fair to say that true change most often does take real work

and some of the information was just plain wrong. i trashed the book when it made me freak out in the 20th week because i couldn't feel the baby move. it advised that i should call the doctor. when i did, i found out most women don't feel it move until 21 weeks. unfortunately i found this out after i had cried my eyes out thinking something was wrong.

1494,"dr. amen has changed my life and the lives of several members of my family.  the stigma associated with mental illness is deep-seated and difficult to overcome. understanding the root causes, particularly the genetic predisposition within families, is the indispensable first step in coming to grips with dealing with life-long problems.  these problems are often not adequately addressed via behavior modification or cognitive therapies because they get the cart before the horse:  they do not deal with the biological root causes.  once those are dealt with, the learned behaviors and habitual patterns can be peeled away to create a whole new start on life.  however, without the understanding of the causes and types of underlying brain conditions, one is often doomed to the roll the rock up the same hill only to see it roll down again as we watch.  take my advice.  if the brain pattern descriptions look all too familiar, get help as recommended.  you will become a new person, the one you were created to be.  and that is a wonderful thing

8,"i think in retrospect i wasted my time on this one. it had a great premise that indulged me into buying this book but who knew dark days lied ahead of me. as i read through the last chapters trying to uncover the mystery, i kept on hoping that there would be something more to it, something more enigmatic, a brilliant twist but i was left with despair. my major problem with this novel was there were not enough, in fact hardly anybody whom the reader could suspect as the possible killer. and bringing out a totally new character at the very end to describe the proceedings only shows a lack of respect to the mind of the reader who had been guessing until now about various other possibilities. i will never touch this author's book again! a mantra for reading thrillers is in believing the hype and read the best of the best-dan brown

906,"i am a big fan of the missing manual series. previous books have given me lots of insights into my installed software and have made my computing time much more efficient. i therefore approached this book with much enthusiasm. office is such a gargantuan program, with tons of bells and whistles, that microsoft itself estimates that most users  take advantage of less than a third of its capabilities.

however, the book is a major disappointment, because of its many mistakes and poor organization. most of the mistakes are ones you can work around--for example, on page 8 the topics covered by appendixes a and b are reversed--but the sheer number of such mistakes makes reading the book a major distraction. every few pages i find myself going to the missing manuals web site to report yet more errata, such as incomplete or wrong instructions, figures that do not agree with the text or figure captions, incomprehensible writing, seeming confusion between the mac and pc versions of the program, etc. and i agree wholeheartedly with a previous reviewer who complained about the inadequate index.

it looks as though o'reilly publishers did not do an adequate proofing of the book, but instead rushed it out as soon as possible. that is too bad, because i will now be much more hesitant to purchase another missing manuals title
"
660,"for the english-language reader wedgwood's book, which has been in print for over sixty years, is still an excellent introduction and synoptic narrative of this lengthy and turbulent period of european history.  it gives brief and judicious biographical sketches of the major political and military actors of three generations:  the principal antagonists at the outset -- ferdinand ii of austria and frederick v, elector palatine;  the condottieri-style generals - spinola, von mansfeld, tilly, wallenstein, piccolomini, christian of halberstadt, bernhard of saxe-weimar, the duc d'enghien (conde); the contentious minor rulers --  maximilian v of bavaria, johann georg of saxony; the northern monarchs -- christian iv of denmark and gustavus adophus of sweden (and his daughter christina and prime minister, oxenstierna); the ""spoiler"", cardinal richelieu; the new emperor ferdinand iii and his cousin, the warlord cardinal-infant ferdinand of spain; and many others.  this book is written in a traditional english historian's  prose style that is clear, eloquent and totally lacking the jargon of concurrent and later social and economic histories, while still covering these aspects of the period.  in spite of some reviewers' claims of a ""protestant bias"" in her interpretation, the author seems extremely fair when assessing responsibility for the long-running disaster of the war, taking the position that it was the self-serving political interests of  the participants (dynasties, rulers, generals and paymasters) that kept the war going at the expense of the social and economic welfare of the vast majority of inhabitants of germany and bohemia.

     although i am not familiar with this new edition (and grafton's introduction) i emphasize that any reissuing of this book should have a brief scholarly introduction which supplies more details on the constitutional arrangements and crises of the holy roman empire during the sixteenth century, with a special emphasis on the composition of the bohemian estates and the conflicts between the estates and the habsburg king-emperors.  the extent and internal organization of ""the bohemian crown lands"" should also be outlined.  a succinct review of the political status of lutheranism, calvinism, the bohemian brethren, and other protestant confessions throughout all of europe around the year 1600 and  a note on how their status had altered by 1700 would also be useful in ""setting the stage"" for the events of 1618 and understanding the relgious-denomination consequences of the war.

     the author supplies sufficient details on the major battles, but this is not a work of military history.  as wedgwood knows, battles were only significant in the larger view as a result of their  political consequences.  and it is in the elucidation of the underlying politics of the war (including how political prospects shifted with the waxing and waning of military fortunes) that wedgwood excels.  in her analysis of the general european situation at the outset of the war she proposes that there were three sets of  forces which underlay and drove contemporary events.  each was a source of conflict and each might cross-cut the others, complicating the declared interests and objectives of the dynasties and nations involved.  in brief, the forces were: (a) religion, with three major competing factions (catholic, lutheran, calvinist; she notes that the conflict between the latter two forms of protestantism was often as extreme as it was between each of them and the roman catholic church).  (b)  nationalism (french, german, czech, etc.), which was a new force on the scene, crystallizing the idea that political entities might be defined by nationality (which here equals some combination of ethnicity and native language) rather than conceived of as polyglot territorial agglomerations brought about by dynastic interests. (c) monarchic-constitutional issues, which were especially complicated and ambiguous within the ""constitutional"" grouping of major and minor powers known as the holy roman empire (hre).

     the constitutional problem was twofold.  within the small arenas of developing nation states and the yet smaller ones of traditional rulerships throughout europe (duchies, counties, ""free-city"" areas ruled by town councils and mayors) contests over the basis and extent of the rulers' powers and privileges were taking place.  aristocrats, oligarchs and merchants had traditional corporate bodies (estates) reluctant to cede their own powers (taxation, the organization of military service) to a central authority.  the same conflict was also being played out on the larger scale of the  hly roman epire, that loose grouping of special obligations and exemptions  which was the final residue of an earlier system of vassalage binding together the elected emperor (who had been a habsburg for several centuries) and the smaller rulerships of central europe.  the religious reforms, rebellions and wars of the sixteenth century had produced a system that appeared to resolve some of the potential problems through the won privilege of cujus regio, eius religio (""whoever rules, his religion [is the religion of the ruled area]"").  in the year of the war's inception, 1618, this new balance was very fragile, comprising four catholic and three protestant imperial electors.   in germany the special arrangements regulating relationships between the emperor (resident in vienna or prague) and local rulers and guaranteeing a great deal of political autonomy to the locals, especially the protestant electors, had been somewhat codified by the augsburg treaty of 1555, and were known as the ""german liberties"".  these would prove to be especially important to the three protestant electors at the outset of the war.

    in the developing continental war one could be pro- or anti-habsburg based on any one of the above factors or any combination of two or three of them.  for example, a catholic ruler (including the papacy) might seek protestant allies in order to combat habsburg territorial expansion in his direction or to combat constitutional changes in the empire which affected his position adversely.  or a protestant power might accept the habsburg ""program"" in any given case because it did not wish to disturb constitutional arrangements that were to its advantage (this  characterization is apt for saxony and brandenburg during the first twelve years of the war.)  

     as wedgwood notes, all three considerations (religion, nationality, constitutional relations) could be and were used cynically to advance the positions and interests of individual rulers and factions.  from the point of view of rationality or predictability, political choices and commitments were often self-contradictory (e.g., a catholic power supporting a protestant venture; a german liberties party accepting occupation by the army of a foreign power, etc.) or  temporary expedients that made the overall european situation more chaotic.  the war began locally in bohemia, but its complications and consequences radiated outward as far west as spain and england (even farther, to the caribbean naval theater), as far north as sweden and northeast to poland, as far south as italy and southeast as transylvania; in other words, it was a european continental war with global impact.

    when the war broke out in 1618 it was over the habsburg violation of a ""constitutional guarantee"" of religious freedom in bohemia (the concessions stated in rudolf ii's letter of majesty).  and here is where individual personalities and beliefs played an important role.  ferdinand ii, who had knowingly violated the terms of the letter soon after being selected by the bohemian diet as king (and therefore the first in precedence of the hre electors) was determined not only to expand the political powers of the habsburg dynasty in bohemia and elsewhere, he was firmly committed to the goals of the catholic counter-reformation (i.e., re-catholicizing all of the areas within the hre which had become protestant during the last one hundred years).  when he was deposed by a special convention of the bohemian estates (the defenestration of his deputies in prague being the signal event of this deposition), the crown of bohemia was offered to the elector of the (rhineland) palatinate, frederick v, who considered himself a champion of the protestant cause.  the religious zeal of these two antagonists led to extreme fixed positions at the very outset of the war.

    given the other major conflict hovering in the background  -- the spanish habsburg determination to recover the now protestant area of the netherlands which had become the successful and defiant (dutch) united provinces - the war soon became international. while the entry of france and then denmark followed by sweden, into the war during the 1620's changed its nature and extended its duration, wedgwood concentrates much of her analysis on the behavior of the two protestant electors, johann georg of saxony and georg wilhelm of brandenburg and one catholic ruler, maximilian of bavaria.  it is her contention throughout the book that johann georg and maximilian in particular could have prevented the war's spread and forced ferdinand into a compromise very early in the course of events that acquired their own dynamism once they got out of hand.  despite their religious differences these two were always strong ""german liberties"" proponents, and each had the same view of the austrian  habsburg rulers:  they should be kept for the broader protections they offered, but kept in place with respect to encroachments on the traditional rights of local rulers.  in the end both of these rulers survived the lengthy war in spite of numerous diplomatic and military reversals (saxony switched sides and joined the swedes for several years, while maximilian's position was constantly and secretly supported by  his nominal enemies, the french, as their potential foot in the habsburg camp.)  wedgwood believes that the price of their survival was far too costly for the rest of germany.

     wedgwood's gloss on the changing nature of the conflict is that by the year 1635 the war had become one of great-power politics, and that the earlier religious and ideological causes were losing their ability to motivate the antagonists.  her summary of the changes emphasizes the following:

(a)  religion had  discredited itself as a plausible source of political programs and a legitimate cause for war.  religion was becoming more interiorized and private, and losing ground philosophically and ethically to the new prestige of empirical and applied science (this was the era of galileo and kepler, with descartes, harvey, hook, newton, huygens, etc. on the near horizon; a time of laboratory science and scientific societies.)  as the basis of a political program religion was viewed cynically by those who saw the devastation it had brought about.

(b)  for thinking men, nationalism began to fill the emotional void in public life left by the withdrawal of religion as the underlying motive for political and cultural action.  this was very obvious in france, but even true of ferdinand iii, for whom the new main cause was the construction of an austrian-based hereditary monarchy whose additional obligations as the holy roman imperial  protector of  far-flung  german catholics were no longer perceived as worthwhile.  in the minds of both germans and austrian habsburgs the holy roman empire was becoming an honorific entity with ambiguous and weak political commitments in germany.  the elbe-north german-pomeranian ideal empire of wallenstein was never again revived as a dynastic program.  austria began to move south and east (toward italy, croatia, and hungary) in its expansionist aims.

(c)  the control of immense polyglot, multi-religious, mercenary armies and their huge camp followings had become a pressing matter of concern for all of the political authorities that hired them - they were neither religious nor national in their motives and aims and were in fact independent ""mobile states"" unto themselves, cynical and rapacious and often as dangerous to their paymasters as to their foes; whenever their immediate prospects for pay and maintenance looked bad, they changed sides.  the most successful mercenary generals had become mini-sovereigns.  officers were all ""out for themselves"" and for their troops (rather than for the cause or nation of their paymaster), since without troop loyalty they had no means of personal advancement  -- the most famous commanders, ernst von mansfeld, wallenstein, bernhard of saxe-weimar, the swedish general wrangel, all expected (and some received) grants of territory and titles of nobility as their rewards for service. the ""national"" armies of conscripts that came to the fore in the 18th century was the answer to this problem. 

     the pace of the war wound down during its last five years (although there were several major battles fought even then), which was a period of extended negotiatons in münster and osnabrück, with the ""final treaty"" being signed late in 1648.  for the next five years a series of conferences met at nürnberg to implement and enforce the peace treaty and to deal with difficult problems raised by demobilizing huge armies. many of the loans of this period, which were raised to cover the demobilization costs, were not paid off for a century.   individual rulers such as charles of lorraine and the duke of savoy (who got nothing from the treaty) refused to vacate various fortresses for five or six years, but the war did not break out again.  france and spain continued at war with each other, but not in germany.  numerous soldiers, especially officers, went into mercenary service all over europe.   others took to the hills as professional bandits - for the next 20 years merchants traveled through certain parts of germany and bohemia in armed caravans.

     wedgwood accepts the more recent (1900-1930's) historical estimate that the population of the imperial german lands (excluding alsace and the netherlands) dropped from about 21 million in 1618 to 13 million in 1648.  the number of dislocated people was also substantial.   while she acknowledges that the number of towns and villages destroyed and other ""infrastructural"" and economic losses were very large, she feels that all contemporary sources (e.g., the pamphlet literature of the next 100 years) exaggerated local losses, since all parties in the war continued to seek indemnities and restitution.  the free peasantry benefited briefly, since landowners were desperate for manpower to restore their estates  - prices fell while wages rose for a number of years, which increased the standard of living of peasants and artisans.  but within a decade of the peace treaty the landowning gentry was pleading with imperial, royal and local rulers to impose legal  restrictions  which would re-create bonded, serf-like conditions for peasants. town councils now became pawns and bureaucrats of  the dynastic courts of their rulers and also implemented restrictive legislations on peasants (e.g., prohibitions against mobility, domestic industry, and household craft production  -- a trend which later historians refer to as ""neo-serfdom"").   class stratification was as rigid as it was before the war started.  there was a new, large class of mobile petty nobles and gentry seeking court-backed military and bureaucratic appointments, at the expense of town and peasant taxpayers.  

     germany and the austrian-based monarchy and empire were totally excluded from the international competition to establish overseas colonies and from the developing ""atlantic trade"".   for a number of years the outlets of germany's major rivers (rhine, elbe, oder, and for brandenburg-prussia, vistula) were controlled by  foreign powers, reducing germany's commercial strength.  hamburg was the exception, becoming the major maritime merchant city of the north sea coast, at the expense of the other hanseatic cities and the scandinavian powers.  the only medium-sized german state to emerge with positive prospects was brandenburg, soon to become the administratively efficient and militarily powerful prussia.  the peace, while ending the ""wars of religion"",  set the stage for a long series of ""nationalistic"" wars that subsumed dynastic and religious sources of conflict.  france replaced the habsburg spanish-austrian coalition as the menacing and tyrannical continental power willing to disturb the peace.  austria turned to the south and east and spain lost its great power status and became an economic and cultural backwater.  there was no politically or culturally unified germany within the boundaries of the old empire (french culture began to reign supreme) and the cosmopolitanism (its openness to outside influences) of this area during the 18th century, instead of being a source of pride over its achievements, became a source of lament for later cultural and ethnic purists of  revived german nationalism.

     author's judgment and conclusions:    in terms of  responsibility for the overall disaster, wedgwood points to the futility and self-destructiveness of sincere religious zeal in the cases of ferdinand ii and the elector palatine.  but, from the point of view of failures of practical (and ethical) politics, she highlights the behavior of maximilian and johann georg, who could have prevented the spread of the conflict in 1620 and could have brought the war to an early end in 1635 if they had agreed to work together on a ""unified german program"" which would have forced imperial compromises and concessions had they both stood behind it.  between these two she sees the saxon as the greater victim of military circumstances (pressed by the swedish juggernaut) and therefore less culpable for the mess, while she judges the bavarian as too subtle and too ambitious in pursuit of his own dynastic and territorial ambitions at the expense of a general settlement good for his fellow germans, thus identifying him as the more culpable.  

     beautiful in its style and concision, wedgwood's final summary is also gloomy (as one might expect of a work completed in 1939, on the verge of world war ii):  

     ""as there was no compulsion towards a conflict which, in despite of the apparent bitterness of the parties, took so long to engage and needed so much assiduous blowing to fan the flame, so no right was vindicated by its ragged end.  the war solved no problem.  its effects, both immediate and indirect, were either negative or disastrous.  morally subversive, economically destructive, socially degrading, confused in its causes, devious in its course, futile in its result, it is the outstanding example in european history of meaningless conflict.""
"
1153,"once upon a time i was given a vanity-published book to review. it was an illogical mess, full of breathtaking non-sequiturs. while reading ""iron john,"" i couldn't help thinking of it. the vanity book, however, was at least entertaining.

john eldredge refers to ""iron john"" liberally in his book ""wild at heart,"" and because i considered that a ringing endorsement, i purchased a copy. i can't tell you what a chore it has been to finally finish reading it. the hardest part was not flinging it away in disgust about 17 times.

it's one thing to write a rambling tome full of obscure references; it's another to publish it. that people can slog through it and call it ""profound"" and ""important"" is baffling; what's even more mind-boggling is that people claim that this book ""spoke"" to them. i think it's a case of ""i'd better say i understand it, or people will think i'm not erudite."" well, let me be erudite about it: ""iron john"" is a big, steaming pile of new age crapola. don't say i didn't warn you
"
51,"i'm not a cosmologist, but stephen hawking's universe was so simply written it is essentially condescending.  the language is akin to the level one would read in a newspaper.  moreover, the pictures are second rate pre-contact lense hubble knock-offs (despite being published in 1997), and the book has very little to do with stephen hawking.  sure, he wrote the foreward and did some editing, but it lacks the wit and wonder of a hawking work.  naming the book after him and putting his picture on the front is misleading.  i am a chemist, and despite this, filkin's descriptions of chemical discoveries left even me guessing because he was attempting to dumb-down ideas that aren't dumb-downable, and didn't include diagrams which would be helpful for anyone trying to understand the concepts (like neutrino capturing or particle acceleration).  if you want to learn some cosmology, read &quot;a brief history of time&quot; or &quot;a short history of the universe&quot;.  these are simply written but informative works that won't leave you waiting for substance
"
628,"the book starts off ok with a good introduction of the various api's  and is ok reading up untill chapter 6 ""programming linux audio"".  this is where the book fails terribly.  none of the audio samples will compile and the information about openal is just plain wrong.  first the function used to open a wav file is no the corerct function to use for linux.   the author uses the win32 version.  this is just the start of the openal errors.  minus one star!

second the book's two websites (one of which no longer exists (loki) ) contains no errata and no way to contact the author.  the only information is avalible is a zip file of the books sample files (which do not compile of course).  minus two stars!

ohter things about the book that did not work for me was the fact that the author uses c instead of c++.  while c is still used for game development , most programmers are attempting to migrate to c++ and ood.  books released about 1950 should reflect that!

second the author uses tcl as a game scripting engine.  while i can agree to a point (based on the fact of the easy of implementation)  the author should have used a common scripting engine such as lua.  (although the author does mention at the end of the book that tcl was proably a bad idea.

third the author should have introduced autoconf very early in the book instead of waiting untill chapter 10.

the main thing that i liked about the book was the good intro to programming with linux in general.  the topics of linux debugging and makefiles i thought was good (assuming you have experince in these areas on other platfoms).

also the coverage of sdl was a pretty good intro. 
"
1777,"this is an excellent book.  its academic / sociological approach may put off some lay readers, but that would be too bad.  the subject, and the message, are both very important.  in many ways, this book is similar to &quot;the appearance of impropriety:  how the ethics wars have undermined american government, business and society,&quot; but although this book is somewhat less accessible to general readers it is certainly stronger from a social-science standpoint.  an excellent book, well worth reading for anyone interested in why repeated efforts to stamp out political corruption have borne such mixed (at best) results
"
342," time to pack up my luggage (wouldn't it be nice to have a suitcase like rincewind's?) and take off for discworld while the rain and gloom of a january thaw engulf the northern hemisphere.  ""guards!  guards!"" is the eighth book in the discworld series, in which captain sam vimes of ankh-morpork's night watch gives up drinking and gets married (just the opposite of most folks).  i don't read the discworld novels in order any more, just pick up a favorite and start in.

the blurbs on the back and cover pages compare pratchett to charles dickens (pratchett is better), chaucer, ""j.r.r. tolkien with a sharper, more satiric edge,"" and p.g. wodehouse.  i think any author who garners comparisons with such wildly disparate writers must be in a category by himself.  heck, pratchett is a category by himself.

so on to ankh-morpork where the unique and supreme lodge of the elucidated brethren decides, with a little prompting from its supreme grand master, to conjure up a dragon.  the dragon will cause enough death and property damage (including a vegetable stand and a brother-in-law's shiny new carriage) so that when the supreme grand master's nephew rides into the city with his sharp, shiny sword and slays the beast, the grateful citizens will proclaim him king.

this plot works rather well, except that the dragon decides that it wants to be king and cremates its would-be slayer.  its requirements are simple and traditional:  one well-bred virgin per month, and all of the gold, silver, and jewels in ankh-morpork for its hoard. 

the new regime fires sam vimes from his job as captain of the night watch.  how he wonders, could things get worse?

well, at least he's not a virgin and no one is talking to him in capital letters.
"
598,"not even worth finishing this book!  this author does not know enough to even write this book!  i have personal connections with blackwater and i know not one of the employees is even close to what he makes them out to be.  it is a one sided story not based on facts, which it what most writers do, but purely fiction!  the only few misfortunes blackwater has had is what he bases his book on, not the postive stories that i hear about everyday.  don't waste your money

1309,"excellent. as the title states the ""ultimate"". should be the first book purchased, borrowed or stolen for the enthusiast

812,"wow! i read all these great reviews and thought this would be a great book. luckily, i got it out of the library & didn't buy it. i liked it at first, but then the situations got more & more implausible. then i was reading it just to laugh at it. some of the sentences in the book were completely ridiculous too. if i had the book here at work with me, maybe i could quote a couple descriptions that just had me rolling my eyes. not a well written book at all in my humble opinion. glad the rest of you enjoyed it anyway

1080,"having spent five years trying to establish an open-source software platform standard, in retrospect it would have been awfully nice to have had this book.  if you're going to compete with the big commercial firms you have to be comparable to or better than they are in as many areas as possible

360,"let's face it--if you want to get a non-fiction self help type book published and sold today, you better have a completely original idea--or make it controversial and provacative.  i would hope that ms. bennetts' opinions are written for this purpose since they are so extreme.

i am a college educated stay at home mom of two small boys.  i am proud to be doing that and to be defering to my husband to support me/us financially in this mutual decision.  i feel it's a personal decision to stay home and try not to be judgemental of others, but to me there is no career worth giving up taking them and picking them up from school everyday, helping in their class, having simple chats after school, and most important being very present in their young lives.

does that mean i'm sitting back fat, dumb and happy, expecting 100% to live the fairy tale so i can turn stupid and dependent on him for my every need?  of course not.  our relationship is solid, his job is as stable as one can be, we have good life insurance and a lot of it. here's an important one--we live within our means!  we don't have two leased cars and a house we can't afford. 

in addition, while i have ""given up"" my career to raise my kids full time, i have a lot of skills, drive, and no doubt that in that worst case scenario i could provide an income when and if i need to.

i certainly would hope no one would give up the opportunity to stay home because of these so called realistic fears.  look, if you want to be a working mom by choice--knock yourself out.  but don't look for excuses to justify it to yourself and others by saying you're doing it in case of the worst.  that would be a bigger ""feminine"" mistake

585,"i, too, have an ma in american history, and i was never given reason to think about each of two questions raised by this important book. firstly and fundamentally, what was the timetable by which the british military were expected to leave the former colonies, and, second, what ""property"" could they take with them, especially as ""property"" had a very particular meaning here in the new nation? 
was the revolution in large part fought to maintain slavery? that surely bears on the problematic nature of our constitution.
the wonderfully gifted writer and historian (would that they were always the same thing!)poses these vital questions. and we are fortunate that the near simultaneous publication of david b. davis' inhuman bondage complements this fine effort. so, as one reviewer suggests, it is in some ways an overwritten period, but schama and davis add something new and exciting to the dialogue. my thanks
"
1511,"""the island of lost maps"" is the story of a petty crook named gilbert bland who stole rare and irreplaceable maps in the '90s.  posing as a researcher, bland would enter rare-book collections and slice old maps out of antique atlases with a single-edged razor.  then he would sell the maps to unsuspecting -- or at least unquestioning -- dealers.  before being busted at the peabody library at johns hopkins university in baltimore, he had stolen more than a half million dollars' worth of maps.

""island"" is the first book for author miles harvey.  in the book, he tries to pull together enough material on the crime and map collecting to create an appealing 350-page book.  he is only partly successful.  i found the material on bland's crime fascinating.  however, bland as a subject does not fill the entire 350 pages because his life is dull.  unfortunately the author inflates incidents and descriptions to pad the text.  i found myself skipping pages to get back to the crime.  there is some interesting stuff about map engraving in the age of discovery and modern mapmaking. but as a true crime book, it over extends itself.  it would be a more interesting book to read if it were shorter and more focused

410,"i love these type of memoirs. a person who is not boasting about their skill or having an attitude. simply shares the love of his work and love of his county. all of james herriot's books are wonderfull. i was introduced to the children's books a few years ago and just recently started reading his memoirs. love it, some parts were a bit dry but the books still flowed well and drew you back. love the depth of scenery and anicdotes about the area. recommend any book of his

185,"this book clearly, easily teaches the 5 different ways we each relate to one another.    it is applies very well to couples; however, the principles also provide essential insight into relating with children, colleagues... anyone!  it makes an excellent group book study or a read-on-one's own

959,"there were too many characters, disjointed plot threads, not much of a plot in the first place, and not much coverage of the overall march itself.  it focused on many obscure and unimportant characters who weren't that compelling
"
186,"i'll be blunt.  i didn't care for this book.  i bought it thinking it would delve into the subject of the gnostic sophia.  instead the author goes this way and that and hardly even mentions her.  i really think the title was misleading.  as a sidenote, lucifer is given a bad rap in this book and many concede that lucifer plays an important part in later understandings of gnosis
"
509,"this book offers more information about santa claus than it does the gods/godesses associated with the winter soltice.  the craft projects are cheesey and the recipes terrible.  save your money and do a little research yourself and if you want recipes or craft projects pick up one of those special christmas magazines for ideas you can adapt for a pagan holiday theme.
"
591,"this book reads like a horror novel.

by allowing her dogs (as well as another one in her care) to roam freely throughout an urban area crisscrossed by busy roads, the author demonstrates her utter disregard for the animals' welfare.  not to mention the antisocial attitude she displays with her total inconsideration for her neighbors, and for the countless strangers kind enough to phone when her lost dogs seek refuge on their doorsteps.

oh, and let's not forget the dozens of shelter dogs killed because their potential adoptive homes were filled by the plethora of puppies spawned by the author's choice not to spay and neuter her animals.

this book moves at a peppy pace, and might have been interesting (albeit morally reprehensible) if the author's ""observations"" actually provided any insight.  but those eighteen-wheelers on the alewife parkway veered closer to poor misha than the author's whimsical interpretations stray within range of scientific evidence.  case in point:  she is so clueless about the reality of canine behavior that she inadvertently allows one of her dogs to kill another one's litter of puppies.  oops!

any genuine dog lover (or any human with an ounce of compassion and common sense) will despise this book.  a previous reviewer hit the nail on the head: if ""feelings"" are your road map to life, you might enjoy this book.  if you regularly take your brain out for walk, forget it.  calling this a meaningful book about dogs is like calling ""jonathan livingston seagull"" the definitive text on marine fowl
"
1019,"that about says it all. bill bryson is a hilarious writer. i like reading grammar books anyway, but i was always excited to read this book, as it's so entertaining.

besides that, it can teach (or remind) you of a lot of good rules of writing.

the main problem is that several entries are unnecessary, and some necessary entries are left out.

783,"some of the stuff in here was really screwy. it's not a handbook to the &quot;food and mood&quot; book by elizabeth somer, which is what i thought it was when i bought it. it's a separate program entirely. this one is too woozy and non-western for me. very little hard data to back up what they say, just kind of fruity and flowery

656,"as a fan of gitlin, i was hoping that he'd give me the bottom line - his bottom line - on the air we breathe today, the same way that brave souls such as lasch, marcuse, and bell have done.  but gitlin isn't brave.  he admits, honestly, up front, that he will reach few conclusions, and merely wants to lay out what we face each day on the streets, on tv, and on the net.  what follows is a stream-of-consciousness depiction of life today.  i want more than that from gitlin.  i want his conclusions, not some lame statement that he hasn't reached any yet.  he's not getting any younger.  lots of other fabulous thinkers have failed at this stage of their lives.  it's time for his masterpiece - the next book, perhaps
"
989,"i bought this for a quick trip based on the good reviews and the fact that the new fodor's isn't out yet. this has a lot of beautiful pictures and good background explanations, but isn't great if you actually want to see much beyond holy sites and ruins. the maps are not comprehensive enough (the one for modern jerusalem  didn't cover a third of the city, and the one for tel aviv was tiny), and there is not enough practical information about food, hotels, and getting from place to place. i was disappointed.
"
1757,"this book is not about all people. it is about gifted (in this case that means sensitive) children that are misused to feed their parents narcissism. most children are not that sensitive and hence not suseptible to that specific abuse.

it is possible to be gifted and not be sensitive, but those traits do trend together. 

i agree that reading this book is an emotional experience for those former children, but that is a necessary part of the healing process.

this book pioneered the idea examine this from the child's perspective, and any subsequent critics need to consider this.

i heartily recommend this book for those that have been affected, and the others should give their copy to the library, grateful not to have needed it

1335,"i have read this book, mr. moon's &quot;divide and quit&quot;, mr. khosla's work, &quot;stern reckoning&quot; amongst others on the subject of the partition. ms. butalia's work is so saturated with her personal opinions and idealogy, that it almost ceases to be a work on history than the airing of one's thoughts and mindset. almost a diatribe, if i may. i will agree with what john_galt_who has written. i think he has hit the nail on the head. i did not consider this book worth either the money or the time

1507,"as a fervent admirer of peter bart's previous books, the gross and who killed hollywood, i was extremely disappointed with this one.  i feel he sold out by flacking for peter guber, whose exploits were richly detailed in the book ""hit and run"".  there's really nothing new in here, and you'd be well advised to avoid it
"
1006,"maybe it is me but this novel was about as exciting as watching the grass grow.  it is the first mystery novel that i have read by a female author and i hope that it is not representative of the gender.  but, by the reviews here, all by women, i can see that jance writes to that crowd.  her readers seem to like being taken down the aimless boring pass of relationship drible. if you want to spend 10 pages with the main character sitting and talking about nothing in her mothers house or on her friends porch talking about their health than this book is for you.  it is amazing that jance can start great with the murder scene and then 200 pages later start uncovering her first clue, the insulin bottle.  jance gives no indication that oak vista or the stranded stranger are even remotely related to the story. do not start this book it is absolutely a total waste of time.  if you want a good mystery read coben, crais, patterson or michael connely
"
1536,"one tiresome, heavy-handed simile after another; agonizing, descriptive detail that unnecessarily prolongs action; simplistic, trite phrasing and dialogue -- characters constantly express vague but contradictory emotions in the same sentence, an obvious effort by the author to provoke interest or conflict which falls flat; routine characterization; a sentence or two slipped in during a scene or an unexpected circumstance placed at the end of a chapter meant to build plot and suspense read as forced and predictable; proofreading errors; fragmented, poor sentence structure -- this book is amateurish writing all the way around.  i cannot fathom the reasoning for the quality of the professional reviews which this work received.  i cannot understand the lack of proper editing.  i am an avid reader and approached this book with much enthusiasm, so imagine my disappointment when i was ready to put the book down a couple of pages into the prologue!  in fairness to the author (and with a hopeful attitude), i forced myself through the first 70 or so pages, however with each turning page i found myself reading along just for sport, my mind constantly drifting and more and more incredulous (and annoyed) with this juvenile effort. what could have been a fascinating read due to the intriguing premise is instead a colossal waste of time. 
"
297,"truly the author's pen is mightier than the sword as he takes on christmas, parents, children, evangelical christians from kentucky, television, macy's, the result of a dalliance during the viet nam war, and ""keeping up with the joneses"".  

this short book is much funnier than his best-selling ""me talk pretty some day"" as the author's humorous cynicism is at its best.  one can't put it down for fear of missing some insight into the american psyche.

three of the stories appear to be autobiographical (with obvious changes made to ""protect the innocent"") wherein the author ""tells"" the others in the guise of another.  

regardless, sedaris pulls no punches and will have the reader in stitches, even if there's a little guilt attached to that feeling.
"
597,"the writing was very disjointed in my opinion.  i had to read and re-read many sentences to figure out what the author was trying to say.  it was a struggle to read. no likeable characters.  i made it to the part where it was introduced that madeline slept with the ex-husband and current wife.  give me a break!  i moved on immediately.  too many good books waiting for me to waste time on this absurd tale

fairy dream: fairy and baby, flower pillow, unicorn
wild trail: cowboy and mustang
set to sea: pirate and ratty, dinghy
magical waterworld: mermaid, fish, seahorse and crab, dolphin

there are also pages on knitting, crochet and stitching basics. 
this is probably not a book for a beginner, but if have some experience you ll want to get your needles, hooks and yarn and just get going. 
i can only recommend this one. 5 stars!!!

1653,"more than human is one of those books that has garnered high praise from the science fiction community because of its strong prose and original ideas.

the writing is often compared to that of faulkner but i wouldn't make that connection having read a few of faulkner's works.  sturgeon uses many of faulkner's narrative trademarks (i.e. streaming conscious, first person perspective of low iq individuals, disorienting changes in first person narrative) but i didn't feel the net effect really compared to say something like as i lay dying.

i love science fiction books and the readers in general love the genre which is why they want it to be taken seriously.  this results in undue adulation and comparisons to mainstream books.  more than human is slow, dated and not what i would describe as genre transcending nor would i recommend it to others.  so the idea might of been original in the 50's but topics like telekenesis, esp, computer-brain babies, and self produced morality and ethos have all been tackled more successfully in other science fiction classics before (asimov) and since.  this book rarely set off that wow! button in my head or kept me turning pages.  this book simply did not have enough meat in it to make it anything more than mediocre at best.

in 1953 there were 5 hugo award nominees for best science fiction book (determined in a retro hugo award ballot in 2004)  the retro hugo awards are fascinating because the voting (in this example) takes place 50 years later so the impact of the book on society can't really be ignored.  besides more than human, the far superior the caves of steel, childhood's end, and farenheit 451 were among the other entries in a banner year for classic sci-fi.  needless to say, more than human did not win (farenheit 451 did and rightfully so)

bottom line:  i wanted to like this book and it doesn't surprise me that others give it such high praise.  these are probably people that don't read other genres enjoy congratulatory wankfests
"
357,"i love other preston/childs books so i thought i would love this one.  i didn't.  it is completely predictable.  i was sure that the author would give it some interesting plot twists, but there were none.  and parts of it were ridiculous:  the length of the entombment, the amount of the treasure, the manner of transport, etc.  the only character i really liked was the monkey
"
498,"we absolutely loved ""cloudy with a chance of meatballs"" (i highly recommend it) but this is nowhere near as good.  most of the story is just rehashing the original book, with a little politically-correct ""let's ship the extra food to the hungry"" thrown in.  lame
"
259,"this would have to be the worst book i have ever read.wow will is running from dead people. some one is trying to kill him so cool.how much more boring can you get.i would not recommend this book to a cave man or any thing for that mater. so what i'm saying is it stinks
"
339,"if excelsior college didn't require this for the cpne, i would take it and throw it off the highest bridge i could find.  horribly confusing, doesn't make sense, and i cannot fathom how this would help your clinical practice.  the only redeeming feature is that excelsior does not let you write in this, so i will have a brand new copy of this for sale to some poor nursing student.  i don't mean to sound harsh, but this book isn't easy to use, it is confusing, and contradicts itself

109,"this book provides a good research methodology which covers the
essential elements of starting and operating a small business
from scratch. the author covers the operational and legal issues
in clear english. there are references to another work entitled

- traffic control consultants
- therapeutics
- technical writers who translate legalese or computerese into
  understandable english
- personalized child books
- systems integration
- time management training
- corporate training
- nutrition consultant

- manufacturers reps
- mystery shoppers
- freelance writers
- government contract consulting
- efficiency experts
- outdoor adventures
- noise control via dosimeters
- herbal products distributors
- greeting card senders
- graphic designers and a plethora of others

the book is a good reference guide for anyone contemplating the
start of a small business
"
627,"other reviewers have taken pains to outline the ""plot"" of this baby boomer bodice ripper. suffice it to say author kathryn harrison, scrupulously adhering to some private conviction that ""more is better"" , offers estrangement between identical twins, loss of a child, incest, paternity confusion, mid-life crisis and spiteful erotomania as it crops up in the life of one understandably confused new york shrink. this reader was aching for the hero, will, to book himself onto jerry springer while feeling immensely shortchanged by lines from ms harrison like ""it's just...it's...what is it? will doesn't have a word for what he feels."" (perhaps the character lacks the emotional vocabulary to communicate with the reader: the author, however, should not. in any case, those are lousy, lazy sentences among so many examples.)
in addition to being insufferably, cartoonishly silly, the book is wounded by a dreary internal structure. bad things happen to will-the-shrink, will then regurgitates them at length to his shrink, then buttonholes his wife to regurgitate what happened, what he thinks happened, and what he thinks about what his shrink thinks. 
as for ms harrsion's ""famous"" sex scenes. they practically lie on their backs, fondling their adverbs and panting for penthouse approval: ""she's unbelievably wet and tight and impossibly, almost unnaturally, slippery.""
""envy"", by the way, is ms harrison's 11th book and she should, by now, be getting things more right than wrong
"
65,"the stationery is cute and colorful, but the pages are very cluttered. while the envelopes have spaces to write addresses and put return labels, the pages are too colorful and bold. a ballpoint or ink pen doesn't look good on the paper.
"
1959,"unlike most of the other reviewers here, neither i nor my nine-year-old enjoyed this book. the premise is good, but the family-values morality is heavy-handed and the writing limps along
"
450,"lee smolin is a very deep thinker and original physics theorist, ready if needs be, to question cherished assumptions. one is humbled at how fertile his mind is and how he is familiar with the ideas and the research of so many people

the book is mainly an account of his misgivings about string theory, where he initially states, as he sees it, the five big problems in physics. in this context, he makes the very important point that since the end of the 1970's there has not been a single breakthrough in our understanding of elementary particle physics and, in particular, he claims string theory does not achieve such a breakthrough. 

in making his case against string theory he discusses what string theory has given and shows how it appeared to offer a solution to some of the problems of theoretical physics. but then he builds up his case against the theory. he says that string theory does not reproduce the standard model, probably the most successful theory in physics, but even predicts particles not seen in nature. it did not predict and does not cater for dark energy, nor does it make new precise and falsifiable predictions. in particular he says string theory does not offer a solution to the foundational problems of quantum mechanics.  he also notes that here is no complete formulation for string theory. he shows though how the five versions of string theory could be unified if membranes rather than strings were assumed, but notes that this theory, m theory, still remains a tantalizing conjecture. he says hopes for a unique string theory have receded.

this reviewer would not dare to comment on his assertions but will say that any assertions he makes, are based on a very thorough knowledge of modern theoretical physics and merit the full consideration and respect of the reader. indeed new ideas are needed in physics as lee smolin says. we are missing something big. there is a feeling though that we are on the verge of that big breakthrough - that something just beyond our understanding at the moment will surface through the `murk' into our consciousness and revolutionize our knowledge of nature. the clues are there. to do this, lee rightly says that the sort of people who see through universal assumptions and ask new questions are needed. he also says that progress sometimes requires deep philosophical thinking but sometimes does not. and whether it is `lateral' thinking or a breakthrough revolution in `conceptual' thinking, new thinking is definitely required. lee concludes his book saying that what he intends to do is just that. he chooses to start with a paper of his on the relationship between quantum and thermal fluctuation. a good choice perhaps. 

i strongly recommend that anybody who is interested in physics and the current problems and mysteries in the area to immediately buy this book, if they have not already done so.

1603,"i really enjoyed this coloring book--as in my very early yrs., i had kaleidoscopes to play with.  i was always intriqued with the color spectrum in them.i was hoping to find more on line with the illustrator of this book.  sadly disappointed.  will keep looking at other book sites. by the way, i am 56 yrs. old--and i love to color.  it's wonderful therapy for relaxing and bringing back some childhood fun

"
1298,"the book is well-written.  most parts of it i can agree with.  but there is a crucial mistake in parson's message --- oneness likes to play separation.   i can say clearly that oneness does not play separation.  duality/ego is simply a mistake/illusion caused by mind-evolution.  saying that oneness plays separation is giving reality to this illusion.  also, his message that we can not do anything still gives one a feeling that one is under the ""mercy"" of something, and this is clearly very dualistic.  without ego, both doing and not doing are actions of oneness, to intentionally emphasizing not doing is a mistake.  there are many illuminating sentenses in this book, but be aware of the neo-advaitan trap.  in my life, it was understanding, especially of the process of ego-illusion-image helped me to come to oneness.  the one who is doing the understanding is still oneness.  there is no duality in doing and not doing.  at right this moment, you can chose to continue to read this review or to stop.  of courses, you make choices in daily life.  if you really understand what is meant by ""nond-duality"", you will not make such statements such as ""there is no choice"".

288,"ann coulter is unbelievable in her unrelenting hatred of anyone not in aggreement with her warped sense of reality.  to her there is no middle ground.    i am an educated, well travelled adult who while born in the united states, spent a good portion of my childhood living overseas and consider myself to be fairly open minded.  to be called a communist, a traitor, and an enemy of america just because i don't buy into the ultra conservative mind think is an insult to the freedom that this country was founded on.

1311,"miller knows his subjects (the people) and his subject (their desperation) with a clarity and fearlessness that most people would prefer to avoid.  viewing his photographs are no easier a task than living  wholly and honestly.  skinheads, speedfreaks, tenderloin whores, friends and neighbors.  lucid, terrifying, and ultimately beautiful photographs from a man of the same qualities
"
829,"i'm really disappointed in this book, because the author seems to imply that you can have anything you want, but that is just not the case.  it's a deceptive title.  

i can honestly say that this book is worthless and is not going to help you; you're better off practising feng shui and hanging little crystals in your house than reading this book (and i'm not knocking feng shui, i practise it myself).  people like the author of this book just want to make a quick buck at your expense.  in the end, you'll just feel worse off, looking for the ""next big thing"" to promise you some more snake oil.

another fact i'd like to point out is that this author sells this book in cd format for around $60.00 (i got a flyer in the mail).  if he is truly living life according to his principles why would he even charge for these so-called ""secrets,"" doesn't that go against his own moral values?  one of the gimmicks of the cds is that you can learn the secret sound of ""creation,"" as if chanting ""ahhhh"" is going to make everything alright.  thanks to dyer and others like him, i am completely against any sort of ""positive thinking"" guru.  they are only after your money (while you keep wishing you had more).

*btw, you might be interested to know that after reading this book, you're only going to find out that the big catch is that manifesting your destiny, according to the author, only applies to spiritual matters.  huh?  yes.  the entire book promises you can have anything you want, but it has absolutely nothing to do with material prosperity.  the author also wants you to know that if your desire is not in accordance with ""god's"" plan, you don't have a chance either.  thought i'd mention that before you read this book and end up feeling cheated!

1647,"save yourself time and buy any book by greg lemond (greg lemond's complete book of bicycling) or john howard (john howard's the cyclist's companion) -- they are both far better writers, well-rounded bicyclists, and honorable family men -- good role models for all true cycling athletes, young and old alike.  lance armstrong is good at chronicling his many bicycling events and achievements in this book, but what is notably missing from this text is the experience of a genuine champion.  lance armstrong would sell his own grandmother's last pair of socks in order to succeed -- leaving his family behind in order to pursue his one-dimensional goal of winning the tour de france.  he sold his wife and three helpless kids for bicycling success and he degrades the sport and his wonderful family by publicly flaunting his association with a pathetic and desperate rock singer ... yawn.  better to settle down with greg lemond's wonderful book for real depth, excitement, and rich experience and learn how to become a well-rounded cyclist and a real champion cycling athlete and family champion as well

48,"left for dead by her kidnappers, lore is found by the mysterious woman spanner, who teaches her to survive by her wits and to live in the dark world of crime. the two become lovers, but lore wants legitimacy and to heal from her various wounds (her past with her family, her weeks with the kidnappers), so she leaves, taking a new identity, and tries to fit in. ultimately, lore cannot run from her demons forever, and she must either choose to stay in the shadows or to face the truths of her past. set in the not-so-distant future, &quot;slow river&quot; weaves lore's pasts and present together into an astonishingly compelling tale. at the heart of the book is the story of a young woman healing from abuse, and the science fiction aspects are simply the setting and enhancing details. &quot;slow river&quot; is the type of book that transcends whatever genre in which it's placed: it's more than a science fiction story, more than a coming-of-age story, more than a lesbian love story, more than a story of healing from abuse. this is a book that makes one believe in the power of fiction
"
239,"in all the talk about education issues these days, it's easy to forget that what's really important is the relationship, the energy, between students and teacher.  when the teacher closes his door and is face-to-face with thirty kids--that's where it's at.  it's not test scores or textbooks or innovative curriculum--it's what happens between people in a classroom.  this book shows that dynamic relationship between eager, active kids and a caring, active teacher.  it's not all pleasant, and successes are sometimes small, but a pervasive caring underlies it all.  as a teacher, this book reminded me that sometimes the best thing i can do for my kids is to leave all that paperwork, go for a walk, go to bed early so i can be there for them the next day

1883,"american pastoral was repetitious to the nth degree. i read the human stain a few years ago, and it was good.  but, in pastoral, the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the swede and a psychoanalyst, and between his daughter merry and a psychoanalyst, but absent the psychoanalyst: roth is our psychoanalyst. what he misses, however, is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control. the swede never failed as a father; rather, he failed because he couldn't let go of his sense of responsibility for her

1183,"americans who can't name five poets will name allen ginsberg.  in this case, that is good since he was one of america's greatest poets.  this book attest to this.

1155,"   the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy is the number one best selling book in the galaxy for many reasons. one it is slightly cheaper than others, but most important is that it has the words'don't panic' written in bold letters on the cover. the story of the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy revolves around this remarkable book. this story strangely begins when the earth is destroyed by a vogon construction fleet clearing the way for a hyper space express way. the last earthman, arthur dent, is saved by his best friend ford prefect, who is actually an alien that comed from a small palnet somewhere in the vecinity of betelgeuse. they are soon thrown out of an air lack and rescued by the heart of gold using the infinate improbability drive. inside they meet up with zaphod beeblebrox, the two headed, three armed president of the galaxy, trillian, an earthwoman who arthur failed to pick up and wnt with zaphod, and marvin, a parinoid android. this book tells of there amazing adventures throughought the galaxy. these adventures involve mice, an abandonded planet, a rather suprised sperm whale, and the number 42.
   i loved this book for many reasons. one reason is that it is filled with unexpected humor. another is that it gives a good spin on life. i could always count on this book to cheer me up. don't just stop with this book there are many others in this series.

"
1683,"this book gives the reader a fascinating and personal look inside not just the foster care system, but why they are very much so needed.  young dave's life was very likely saved by being taken from his mother's home and placed into foster care.  but this book makes it clear, that despite this positive change in is life, it certainly didn't mean everything was ""happily ever after"".  dave then struggled with issues ranging from not knowing some of the mere basics that other twelve years olds know by that age, ranging from as simple as how to take a proper bath to how to behave with proper manners.  it also gives you a good look at the struggle these hard working foster homes and parents go through.  they deal day in and day out with children coming from troubled homes, and these foster homes are in such high demand that they end up cramped to the brim.  i think many of us, myself included, are unaware of just what a struggle it is for both the foster children and the foster parents, as well as how much we need to support these people.  they are dedicating themselves to a truly needed and wonderful cause.

thanks again dave, for having the courage to share your beautiful story of heartache and triumph with us

1651,"i would recommend the power of simplicity to everyone.  this book goes far beyond a discussion of marketing strategy.  the idea of simplicity is relevent to all aspects of life.  this book is full of useful information and contraversial suggestions pertaining to marketing strategy.  although the book is considered an educational read, i feel that it is extremily entertaining as well.  it's just an interesting book, it doesnt get much simpler than that

581,"in seeking to develop my own grant writing course, i reviewed 20 books on amazon.  i was sold on this one by its extremely high amazon.com sales rank...probably the highest of this category.

nevertheless, i was shocked and taken aback by a comment on the introduction page, that harkened back to my eighth-grader days: ""you'll learn that in grant writing you especially need to cultivate two abilities: meeting deadlines and following directions.""  

despite the obvious comprehensiveness of the materials presented in the book from ms burke-smith's experience, i don't know who's responsible for the talking-down attitude presented here.  

this is my first everything title, and i don't know if all everything titles are like this, or if it's from award-winning business writer ms tremore.

all i know is after getting such an introduction, what reader would wish to proceed into the book's depths with that kind of attitude by one's hoped-for mentors?

1. biochemistry is a natural science

4. if b, we are no longer in the realm of science

even if behe or proponent of id feel darwinian evolution to be inadequate, for an alternative proposal to be called scientific, it must be ""based on observable, empirical, measurable evidence, and subject to laws of reasoning"".

807,"mark liberman and geoffrey k. pullum could be accused of making the best of an already satisfactory situation in publishing this book that reiterates their ongoing blog on linguistics.  but for this reader, having never visited their blog (until now), this book is a treasure trove of quips and oops and pooh bahs and evidences of the strangely twisted manner in which we communicate.

written in a casual style that makes the faux pas revelations more cogent, the authors share embarrassingly poor writing from the media, from authors, from those in control of the country (as though the mentality of the us might somehow be reflected in the malapropisms of george w.  ...yikes!), and yet reading this blogline of information never seems vitriolic. criticism is one of the most substantial ways to create change and hopefully this book and blogline will focus many minds on the misuse of the english language, perhaps effecting some much needed corrections.

far from the madding gerund (didn't you always wonder why thomas hardy used that word in the title of his great novel 'far from the madding crowd'?) is a book to pleasure the mind - and humor - and a fine resource for perusing before writing or speaking to a group of wise souls.  so maybe it is a print form of a blogline, but for those of us who tire of wading through the computer for reading, it is a complete (?compleat?) pleasure!  grady harp, june 0

126,"this collection of poems, tho representing a fine breadth of dickenson's works, is in final assessment a crime against the poet's great talent.  as is freely admitted in the introduction, the editor, mr. higginson, &quot;worked on the mechanics of the poems by smoothing out the rhymes and meter, changing the line arrangements, and rewriting the dialect of the local area.&quot;  this is a free admission of the book's guilt, having adulterated dickenson's original poems in both content and form.  gone are the nuances and passions that make dickenson one of the best american writers.  gone are the premeditated dashed and capitalizations that add depth and intensity to the poems' meanings.  and, worst of all, gone or altered are many lines that contribute to the unique vision of the artist.  as thomas h. johnson says in the introduction to &quot;the complete poems of emily dickenson,&quot; a representative mid-nineteenth century traditionalist was being asked to judge the work of a wholly new order of craftsman . . . which he was not equipped to estimate.&quot;  do yourself a favor and avoid this text.  instead, find one that is true to the original poems, one which preserves the intent and stylistic genius of the author, and one which will give you the full and lasting effect of emily dickenson

421,"john updike's literary criticism is perceptive and sparely written - every one of his non-fiction collections is worth reading.  but his novels have, from the very first, been precious, over-written and stifling in their desperate need for approbation.  when he writes fiction, he's like a dog doing tricks for reward.

and certainly, the rewards have come.  but for readers outside the us at least, it's all a little mystifying.  john cheever was a far better writer, yet his work seems somehow to be regarded by americans as the lesser canon.  time will correct this mistake, no doubt, but in the meantime updike pours out ever more cloying and over-heated work like this.

if i still have your attention, let me recommend the 'collected stories' of john cheever.  updike could only dream of writing prose like that.

perhaps this came from the fact that henry adams was not a likeable man. he was famous for holding court in his home near the white house, and making caustic and negative comments about every president who lived there. 

granted, he lived in washington at a time when there were plenty of second-rate occupants of the white house. but the thought of people wasting their time trying to please  a blue-blooded snob like adams depresses me. why did anyone bother? he lived in an atmosphere of snobbery, sharp-tongues, clever remarks, and brilliant conversation. the world went on without him, truth be told, and he contributed less than the people who walked by his house each day. 

he was a very good historian in his time. but who reads his books now? not very many. in short, his own work was not as long-lasting as he would have wanted it to be. maybe the influence of some of the presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and purchased work of henry adams.

""the education of henry adams"" does not have much real information. he got education in one place, none in others. surely, the suicide of his wife provided some very painful education for henry--but he wrote nothing about it in his book. 

when eric sevareid wrote ""not so wild a dream,"" it was compared to ""the education of henry adams."" that was meant as a compliment. oddly, i think sevareid's book is much, much better. sevareid wrote of america, the common man, the war, and what it all meant to him. adams needed to get out more. he did not see america--not the america built by the common citizen who put it all together, and defended it.  i gained a trememdous amount from sevareid. i cannot say the same for the work of henry adams. 

again, a lot of this might be me. perhaps i read the book at a bad time. maybe i needed to read it a third time. i do not know. i do know i do not think this is a great american classic. forgive, please, my ignorance.

496,"this book introduces us to the colorful world of a bygone era, that of border radio.  brilliant technicians constructed gargantuan transmitters along the border towns of texas/mexico and beamed their signal into all of north america - one angry resident complained that was all he could get on his radio.  these stations were distinguished by their call signs that began with an 'x'. this spawned an industry of singers, politicians, preachers and pitchman the type we now see on &quot;infomercials&quot;.  mail was the barometer of the day - the more mail you &quot;pulled&quot; in from listeners the more clout you carried with stations - &quot;keep those cards and letters coming!&quot;  new federal regulations put an end to this wild world but not until the airwaves crackled with everyone from wolfman jack to the rev. ike - &quot;get out of the ghetto and get into the get-mo!&quot;  this is a marvelously written treasure trove that will be welcomed by anyone interested in radio, salesmanship, and american sub-cultures and the bizarre

1467,"the literature of september 11 is never attacked.  when a book speaks of september 11 (or of terrorism in general), it is more or less guaranteed immunity from criticism; it will almost inescapably be greeted with sympathy.  jonathan safran foer's extremely loud and incredibly close banks on such sympathy, on such reverence.  the narrative, which concerns a nine-year-old boy named oskar schell in search of a key that would unlock / unshell the enigma of his dead father (a narrative stolen, in its basic outline, from guenther grass's die blechtrommel), could have been written entirely without its scattered references to the terrorist interventions.  nor is this trauma the only one presented in the novel: the others include hiroshima / nagasaki, the staten island ferry crash, and the dresden bombings.  each disaster is generalized to the point at which what is addressed is not a traumatizing event in its specificity, but historical ""trauma"" itself and the overcoming of trauma through bereavement-inspired creation.  oskar, the insufferable brat, attempts to complete the work of mourning for his father, thomas schell, jr., a victim of september 11, by compiling an almanac of self-inflicted wounds, the collage of images and letters which is the book we are ""reading""---an almanac which, most likely, is written sometime in the indefinite future (thomas shell, sr.'s manuscript of 4/12/78 is heavily edited (pp. 208-216).  who has done the editing?  almost certainly an older version of his grandson oskar).  if the term, ""reading"" even applies.  whenever a ""pregnant"" image is described, foer literally re-presents it in the form of a pictorial image.  when a flock of birds rises into the sky, it is not enough that we read of these birds---we must see them as well.  words may not be left in their invisibility; we are presented with supplementary photographs, illustrations, since mere verbality is not enough.  (indeed, the entire novel oozes with misologos --- the mistrust or hatred of language --- in terms of both its content and its form.)  photographs, yes, and also a superabundance of blank pages and nearly blank pages.  space is not used in the manner it is in the works of edmond jabes, for instance.  typography does not substitute for a well-wrought sentence.  foer abrogates himself of all responsibilities --- most specifically, the responsibility to write well.  why bother when the pyrotechnics of typography are at his disposal?  as far as the writing is concerned, it is composed of nothing other than mind-numbingly, soul-deadeningly repetitive phrases (""heavy boots,"" ""raison d'etre,"" etc.) and sunday school platitudes: ""sometimes one simply wants to disappear"" (184); ""there's nothing wrong with not understanding yourself"" (184); ""everything that's born has to die, which means our lives are like skyscrapers"" (245); ""how can you say i love you to someone you love?...  it's always necessary"" (314).  whenever the author writes something that he finds ""beautiful"" and ""true"" (165), he congratulates himself on his brilliance and tells us that that thing is ""beautiful"" and ""true.""  the entire book reeks of such unearned profundity.  we also learn that most dust is made up of human detritus---a very deep truth indeed, one that foer also communicates in his essay, ""emptiness"" (originally published in playboy) with all of the sanctimoniousness and self-righteousness of the faux naif who serves as the center of the novel, a sunday school lecture in which we learn that famous musicians (ringo star) and scientists (stephen hawking) are unthreateningly approachable: everything is familiarized.  perhaps it is wrong to criticize foer for including so many blank pages in extremely loud and incredibly close, since the entire book is a vacuum: null space into which readers may project their own meanings.

"
187,"though only a fraction of books have been written about the great war when compared to wwii, there are some great ones to pick from. for instance, for a great narrative of the american involvement in world war i, try the doughboys by gary mead. for a good look at the events of gallipoli, just last year john laffin wrote the agony of gallipoli, which is a wonderful brief book on that travesty of warfare. there is a great book which chronicles verdun called the price of glory by alistair horne. the list goes on and on, whether it be flanders, the somme, passchendaele, africa, jutland, whatever your area of interest might be. the point i'm making is, there are plenty of specialized accounts of world war i, and even several overviews of the war, but john keegan's the first world war, is a great source for an overall study of the war. 

this book covers it all, in brief detail. accounts are given on virtually every facet of the war and even some of the best insight available for the events which led up to the war itself. every aspect of the war is given its due diligence here. 

i've never been a big fan of keegan. his writing, to me, is a struggle at times. this book is no exception. it reads somewhat like a 500 page textbook and borders on tedious at times. but as much as i dislike his stuffy british writing style, he is a virtual historical genius. his knowledge and research of the events cannot be faulted, and he writes, for the most part, without imparting his own commentary. in fact, without prior knowledge, one would hardly surmise that keegan is himself, british.  

the big exception to that is keegan's typically british hard line stance of not giving the american forces their just dues. in this aspect, he even contradicts himself in several places. he goes to great length to illustrate to the reader that in the early months of 1918, germany was still very much capable of winning the war. the western front had been bolstered by the arrival of german troops from the now defunct eastern front. the new soldiers from the east brought with them, battle hardened experience and a mindset that they could triumph, as they had in the east. he goes on to tell of how effective german advances had been in early april, advancing a fifty mile wide front over twenty miles in a matter of days. he then follows this sort of information with telling the reader how, though ambitious and courageous, the american forces were largely inconsequential to the conclusion of the war.  when he does acknowledge american victory, it is quickly followed with excuses for the german forces. 

that said, if you're seeking information about just how american forces rallied to bring an end to over four years of war in a matter of a few months, this book will infuriate you. however, if you are looking for a good overview of the war as a whole, this is one of the best out there. i should add, the book has a quite lengthy notes and bibliography section for further study.

1562,"overall, i think this is a very good book for someone who is trying to turn their health habits around, but is overwhelmed by all of the possibilities.  it also a good track to run on for someone who wants to implement important life changes in an easy step-wise fashion.  there is nothing fanatical about the recommendations and they can be easily implemented by almost anyone.

one of the things i most like about this book is the encouraging tone and the prioritization of various changes that are made little-by-little in eating habits, exercise, etc.  this book recommends walking as the main source of exercise and gives some great arguments for why this makes sense.  i think there are also some good and simple nutritional guidelines e.g. eliminated trans fatty acids, eating more fiber, using more olive oil, etc.

mixed in with some well researched conclusions are dr. weil's opinions.  for example, he recommends a fairly simple supplementation regimen.  while it is true that not everything he says is necessarily supported by corresponding studies, it is also probably that some of it is on the mark, but the data is not all in or all of the variables are not possible to isolate.  at the least, i don't see where this level of supplementation would do harm to most people.

i also like that dr. weil takes a holistic approach to health.  he not only looks at and talks about the body.  he also addressed stress and relaxation, life attitudes and other ingredients of a healthy life that impact on health.  while he is very commercial, he is also a harvard trained physician and i do think that he has some very good insights to share.

while in some ways i think this book can be better.  i would still recommend it to almost anyone, especially people who are intimidated by the idea of exercising and changing their life habits.  while not every suggestion might be on target, i am sure that if someone implemented all the suggestions over eight weeks, they would undergo a big positive change in the state of their health.  i have certainly found this to be true and i cheat on some of them   ;

1181,"i read this book 2 years ago, and still consider it one of the most compelling and important books i have ever read. besides being completely absorbed by this man's life and experiences, i learned so much valuable information about cambodia from it that i wish it was required reading for anyone traveling there. 

blended seamlessly with the narrative you will learn of the history and culture of the cambodians, the groundwork for the rise of the khmer rouge, the horrors and fallacies of life under a communist regime, and the story of pol pot. i also gained an insight into buddhist thought and daily life in cambodia, all of which prepared me well for my trip there.

haing ngor's life story also helped me understand the damaging psychological consequences endured by the victims of this holocaust, and of the difficulties cambodians have had in trying to adjust to life in america. there are a lot of lessons to be learned from this book, and many which can give us a better ability to analyze current international events. if you read no other book about cambodia, read this one

977,"i loved the core knowledge curriculum.  the reason i switched my children to a charter school is that they started out teaching ck.  i also switched them back to the public school when the principal got away from ck and made it just like a public school.  

i agree that a teacher should supplement what is in the ck books to give their students a better understanding of the material.  teaching the information exactly how it is presented in the books would be very dry.  

however ck is a great outline of what should be taught.  it covers a tremendous amount of knowledge including the fight for civil rights, all religious ideology, multicultural literature and more.  if there is a problem with the books, it is that many children would not be motivated to learn the wide variety of topics covered. for many it would be too much.  also weak teachers would be overwhelmed trying to cover everything.   

hence, anyone claiming that ck supports a racist philosophy has never read the books.  also i want to point out that the reviewer who called the books racist misspelled the word.  it is not spelled rasist.  i also find it disturbing that the reviewer is supposedly a teacher.  when attending school, maybe that teacher would have benefited from a core knowledge foundation.

1071,"this book was written in 1982, updated in 1995. it has a whole section on cameras, which isn't useful since most of them are outdated. doesn't even mention digital cameras. since it specifically discusses the mechanics of cameras, i found this book to be disappointing.

341,"timothy hart lost his b-25 over germany in 1942 and is spending the rest of the war as a guest of the third reich in stalag luft 13.  in 1944 tuskeegee airman lincoln scott arrives in camp and is promptly accused of cutting the throat of smuggler vincent bedford.  the prisoners demand a trial, their jailers agree, and ex-harvard law student hart is appointed to defend scott, who appears inexplicably less than grateful.  

	in fact their german jailers are more helpful to the defense than either scott or the american officers, or so it seems, as scott's trial for murder progresses against a backdrop of class conflict, racial hatred and world war.  atmospheric to the point of claustrophobia, a perfectly paced plot, and one of the few times i've been completely blindsided by a novel's climax.

189,"we have used this book as a text for discrete math courses in our undergraduate computing engineering and systems program (university of los andes, colombia). there are a lot of advantages using this approach instead of the classical one (e.g., people really learn to prove and learn to write correct proofs). 

however, to grasp these ideas you have to be patient and open minded. when other reviewers give 1 star to the book it is clear for me that perhaps they were expecting something magical that did not occur. this presentation of logic and its applications to informatics provides an excellent way to learn and really use the knowledge in the praxis. 

in chapter 8 you go seamlessly from propositional to higher order logic. sums and logical quantifications are, for example, treated in an uniform way. maybe the type concept is not so fine explained, but one has to remember that this is an introductory book.

5 stars, of course

1868,"i had never read any of  vernor vinges books before, but i had heard he was an excellent author, so i thought i would try this.  boy, am i glad i bought it used on amazon for about only $4.  i simply had no idea what was going on in this novel. the plot is unintelligible. i dont know what the bioweapon  the jacket refers to is? i dont know what ""the rabbit"" is.  i see that numerous other reviews here, did not know what was going on either. i do not understand how someone could write so incoherently. 
the concept of someone who had alzheimers getting cured & entering a future society is great - but it never goes anywhere.  the only reason i did not fall asleep, was that i was trying to figure out what was going on, but i did could not  even finish this book

1230,"i thought i was fairly familiar with the sanibel island area, but this book definitely gave me new insight. the author definitely ""knows her stuff"" and has written a very informative and interesting guide. anyone visiting sanibel (especially first-timers) should definitely get a copy before they go.
"
200,"i truly wanted to like this book.  after years of avoidance i had just finished moby dick and found it not only more readable than i'd feared but downright enjoyable.  in addition i'd heard nothing but good things about this novel whose premise certainly intrigued me, and like its predecessor it has one of the truly great opening lines in literature:  ""captain ahab was neither my first husband nor my last.""  alas, it was all down hill from there; overall this is one of the worst books i've ever forced myself to finish.

this came as quite a surprise because the author is no untalented hack.  author of two other published novels and a short story collection, director of a university level creative writing program, long-term teacher of writing, and holder of a ph.d. in same, all to considerable critical acclaim, she should be correcting and grading (failing) garbage like this not producing it.  so what went wrong?  how did this novel end up so awful?  the answer is brick by brick and piece by piece.  there is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things.

length: if ""brevity is the soul of wit"", this novel's witlessness is easily explained.  at 666 pages (interesting number that) this novel is about three times as long as it should have been.  it would seem that, to some extent like melville before her, naslund confused length with importance, but melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is.  imho this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self-parody.  somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel, but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing... with a meat axe or a chainsaw.

the name dropping: one of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures, but if badly handled these encounters can un-suspend disbelief and downright offend.  they are badly handled here.  an almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid-nineteenth century new england and those she doesn't utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with naslund's peculiar imagining of nathaniel hawthorne.  one or two of these, developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude.  as it is, it is a zelig or a forrest gump without the humor (or the self-awareness).

the politics: even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid-nineteenth century new englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel, so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing.  however, naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having una espouse the politically correct view on every single controversy of the day (and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day) from slavery to whaling, from feminism to free love, from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled, all without consequence or even criticism.  this latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves.  una espouses them with all the negative consequences that naslund receives for espousing them today, which is to say: none.

the anti-christian bigotry: there is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid-nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time, but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted.  it is even sillier to portray christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish, the bigoted, the future apostate, or the mentally ill.  it tells us more about the author than anything else that una is openminded towards every religious and quasi-religious idea of the time except christianity.

the farfetched scenarios: i sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi-lesbian encounter....  after this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic.  after her crazy christian father threatens to kill her (a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand), una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal-minded aunt and uncle, encounters two young men who both fall in love with her, disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them, successfully avoids detection, is sunk by a whale, survives by committing cannibalism, marries the surviving young man after he goes insane, and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the indians, leaving her free to ""marry"" captain ahab (una never really ""marries"" anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes).  things don't get more realistic in the second half, which includes una's clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale.  riiiight.

the mary sue: however, the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a ""mary sue"" that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader.  a more realistic main character might have saved it.  una never learns anything from her life's too-many-to-be-believed experiences because she already knows everything.  she doesn't change because she is already perfect.  she doesn't have to deal with the criticism of others because she doesn't receive any, and she doesn't have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides, una had her reasons (and they were very good ones you can be sure).

the only thing i can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone without anyone ever reading it.  i feel like i've just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading moby dick in her bedroom... with the door locked.

1234,"whenever my eczema flared up, my friends would tell me i'm too stressed out.  i didn't feel that way, not much more stressed out than usual, so the timing of the flare ups and the stress level at that time was sometimes confusing. 
after reading this book, however, i recognized it's much more than just the simple stress - more deeply rooted issues i've apparently held for a long time.  i had vaguely suspected this may be the case, but didn't know how/where to start.  this book gave me the guidance to do that on my own.

i agree with 3 other reviewers completely. i no longer feel helpless and scared when i can feel my skin starting to flare up. i am not yet free from eczema, but knowing what may be the underlying cause of it, and how to calm it down, i have much stronger sense of being in control of my skin, body and my life

1933,"what do you do when the world is coming to an end right before your very eyes, but no one seems to believe you?  that is the concept facing dr. thomas more, distant relation to the famous/infamous saint thomas more, in walker percy's novel ""love in the ruins"".  the united states is at a time of crisis, but few seem to understand the implications of the events unfolding around them.  it is up to dr. more, who knows how to diagnose the problem, but not necessarily treat it, to try to prevent the chaos from happening.

the story begins on a hot fourth of july, with doc staking out the abandoned howard johnsons motel in town.  in three separate rooms he has cocooned his three paramours and he is waiting for an event that he knows is going to happen; an event that could very possibly bring about the end of the world.  the novel then shifts back in time to the three previous days, tracing doc's journey that led him to seek refuge at the motel.  the reader learns that he has created a ontological lapsometer, a sort of ""stethoscope of the human spirit"", through which he can diagnose exactly what ails a person's soul, and finally discovers how to treat it.  meanwhile, there is a revolution brewing; the bantus and love children are ready to take over what the white man has destroyed, if a major catastrophe doesn't befall everyone before that can happen.

""love in the ruins"" is a truly southern novel, crafted through percy's intelligence and tempered with the same absurdity that is a trademark of great southern writers such as percy and flannery o'connor.  the reader must suspend disbelief as to the events unfolding, even though they are frighteningly realistic, and not so far-fetched in this present day.  percy's hero doc more is an antihero on par with those of hemingway; flawed, prone to drink, forever chasing after women who are wrong for him.  this novel is his coming-of-age, in a sense, because doc learns what it is he wants out of life, and how to best achieve that.  subtitled ""the adventures of a bad catholic at a time near the end of the world"", ""love in the ruins"" is a deliciously funny and poignant look at a near-apocalyptic america

1631,"i didn't see the other reviews until after my copy arrived. having now wasted a weekend reading this book, i have to agree with everyone. the topic sounds great, the book isn't
"
138,"despite early promise, marked by intriguing personal observations and evident self-reflection, this effort fails to deliver on the author's experience and acumen.  the book is a disparate set of chapters and lacks a unitary thread, apart from a bitter leavening of asides on the shortcomings of united states rhetoric and policies on africa.  i had hoped for more, given the fine record in newsprint of this well-traveled journalist.

"
278,"i read an interview with mr. vollman, i think a couple years ago, i can't quote directly but he said he thought that prostitutes were very spiritual people.  they save marriages, they provide comfort to the loneliest, most desperate among us.  in practically the same breath he observed that they spread disease and sometimes rob their johns.

that kind of duality is at the heart of much of vollman's writing.  on the surface, whores for gloria is one desperate, delusional man, so eager for even the illusion of relatedness that he attempts to recreate gloria with bits and pieces of other prostitutes.  it isn't fully clear if gloria herself was ever real, but regardless, it is now a quest to fill that void collage style with physical samples, such as hair clippings, as well as emotional artifacts.  the most poignant scene may be the protagonist hiring a prostitute, and wanting nothing more than to hear happy childhood memories.  the prostitute complies as best she can but, story after story, the narratives veer into disturbing material.

the hardest thing for the human to do is to hold opposite opinions about one thing at the same time.  the more intelligent and observant one is, the more painfully aware of the absurdity of this task, the more painfully aware of the mental contortions necessary to maintain the illusion of meaning.  this is where the magic lies in true artistc genius, such as a thelonius monk solo or, in this case, vollman's writing.  i've never read anything that better communicates simultaneous beauty and ugliness.  and no better forum than gutter sex, which vollman renders both repulsive and compelling.  and he doesn't do it by being overly clever.  he does it through the chaos of brute honesty.  whatever compositional gymnastics go into the writing, the end product is very readable and deceptively simple

556,"    the story, walk across the sea, by susan fletcher, takes place at a town near the ocean. white people thought themselves superior to others, especially the chinese. chinese were often looked down upon and shunned, mainly because of their religious beliefs. the lighthouse keeper's daughter, however, was different from other white people. believing her father's talks about chinese people in the beginning of the story, the girl, eliza jane, meets a chinese boy around her age. after the chinese boy saves her goat, eliza becomes interested in the boy's behavior. soon, she learns that everyone may not be as they seemed.
    this story was rather interesting in a way. the time of the story show how the characters act and think. the story also shows how different some characters are, such as eliza's father and mother. (""something moved inside me, like a sudden shift in the wind."") eliza was also, in a way, different from other white people. she befriended and showed kindness toward the chinese boy. (""`you'll do him no harm? i have your word on it?'"") i was also amazed by the twist of the story when the story reveals that the father truly worries about the chinese boy.
    of all of the stories i have read, i have never found one that was perfect. this story is no different. when the chinese people were driven out of the village by angry white people, i could feel the same shock and anger eliza felt. the story, however, has a few more bad parts. one boy, amos, accidentally broke eliza jane's nose while trying to find the chinese boy. afraid that he might get in trouble, the boy lied to his father about breaking eliza's nose. to make matters worse, amos blames the fault on the chinese boy! (""i had a mind to shout at him, to tell him to put her down..."") on the other hand, i did not like how eliza acted toward the chinese boy when they first met. when the boy yelled a warning, eliza thought he was trying to scare her off so he could steal her goat. therefore, when the boy was holding the goat, eliza thought that he was taking the goat from her, when what really happened was that the boy saved the goat from a wave. even so, that was not the worst part of the story. (""`get you from me,' he said. `i can't be near you now. get out of my sight!'"") as a father, eliza's father was expected by me to listen and talk to eliza about her chinese friend, and maybe even understand why she was protecting him. as a result, i was shocked and disappointed in her father when he told her that he did not even want to talk to her! thankfully, there was nothing worse than this part of the story.

511,"i actually discovered this book accidentally. it was in the ""return to stock"" section of my borders book store and i was perusing the many books people had been interested in. the summary caught my attention, but it was the first page that drew me in. even from the beginning this book is captivating. it's thrilling, tragic, heart-breaking, and even at times so amusing. greer has a talent for making max seem so real. i couldn't stop reading it. it's so hard to put down! definitely one the best books i've ever read.
"
945,"as gifted a story teller as he is a veterinarian, james herriot has the rare ability to bring out every emotion known to the human race with a single magical flick of his pen. every living thing is without a doubt one of the crowning achievements of a master, and is possessed by a single, true trait that is difficult to find in many commercial books- every single tale is told straight from the heart. you will never fail to laugh at the hilarious tales and cry at the most poignant moments. if you're an animal lover, or even just have a passing interest in animals, this is a book you will hold on to and re-read until the end of your days. kudos, james herriot, you are very much missed
"
1644,"this is another piece of lowbrow anti-german propaganda dressed as historiography.

the book is a mess of primary, yet selective and biased historical research, simplistic psycho-babble, ridiculous sociological-anthropological speculation, pathetic organization behavioural theorising and last but not least, absolutely third rate military history. the author is hell bent on proving that there is a german sonderweg from the founding of the second reich to hitler, that the vaunted german army is nothing but foolish automatons predisposed to atrocities and mindless offensives.

all in all, cheap trash billed as history.

"
1623,"there are two different types of larkin poem. the first type, mostly written before 1955, are influenced by yeats and auden and are mediocre. the second, written when he found his voice, are amongst the most wonderful works of english literature ever written.
so what was his voice? basically that of twentieth century man - atheistic, obsessed with sex, regretting the loss of faith and the old certainties. he takes these subjects and turns them into glorious poems. but here's the really incredible thing: he uses ordinary, uncomplicated language. no tricks, no arcane allusions, just plain english.
it can't be denied that the voice is bleak, and it is too uncompromising for some. however, those who like looking into the heart of darkness will find poems which they will remember for the rest of their lives.

699,"i was referred to this book by my midwife (debra o'conner) as a book that i had to read as it's content was so &quot;right on&quot; and was she ever right.  i know alot about my body.  i am a licensed massage therapist and a mother of a 3 year old that i had at home.  i spent hours and hours learning about my body during the childbirth process.  that was great knowledge to add to the physiology i learned during my massage training.  this book though, is something that every woman in our culture today should read. i now understand so much about my life and the directions it has taken!  i hope to give this to everyone i know who has a daughter.  i hope they will read it for themselves and then pass in on to their daughters when they feel the time is right.  our culture today is so lacking in this kind of positive message.  it is women's reality and needs to be shared.  of course it is written by a midwife!  thank you elizabeth
"
741,"quiller's guide is the most systematic color text available. it combines a deep knowledge of traditional color theories with a huge amount of quiller's personal research into how paints actually mix as colors. central  to the book is quiller's color mixing wheel for watercolors, oils and  acrylics, probably the most accurate color wheel available in any published  work (though he has a revised color wheel, available separately). he  explores the monochrome, analogous, complementary and split complementary  color schemes through many demonstration paintings and detailed mixing  instructions. he emphasizes repeatedly the importance of a strong value  composition, and careful variations in color saturation, in building the  painting. an indispensible book

1240,"i am not a student.  i wanted to read the great gatsby but i had no one with whom i could discuss the story.  i decided in a momentary lapse of judgment to supplement my reading with the cliffs notes.  unfortunately, it was full of grammatical errors and what i found to be very superficial commentaries

491,"first let it be said that this book leads you to believe that he hikes the whole trail... he does not. he hikes less than a third. you dont find this out until 2/3 through the book, which is right about when the book goes from passibly bad, to an ill effort to fulfill a contract. 

my conclusion on this book is that he was contracted to hike the trail by his publisher, could not, and stuffed the remainder of the book with verbatum history lessions and whole cloth inserts of useless statistics. 

as others have said in this review forum. this book can be snide, highschoolish and down right mean. i fail to see the ""wit"" in his endless negitivity and bashing. 

this book has a few funny parts, but i cant help but feel that it is a huge exageration of real events, and is mostly contrived fictional accounts which he uses to air is nasty comments. it is so unbelievible in places, that you know you are on an imagined tangent. 

dont waste your money or time. i am so happy i bought it for 25 cents at a yard sale!

1194,"if you're intimidated by tolstoy or dostoevsky's long masterpieces, consider starting instead with turgenev's ""fathers and sons.""  this book is of course a masterpiece of russian literature.  it's characters and themes are timeless and absolutely relatable to our modern culture.  this is a story of family relationships, romance, and philosophy.  highly recommended.

203,"if you just want the latest research, go read the new england journal of medicine.  if you want the latest research plus experience, understanding, compassion, and answers to your most embarrassing questions, get this book!  

i heard the co-author, francesca coltrera, speak a few weeks ago. i was absolutely blown away by how lucid, informed, and compassionate this woman was. she didn't just present the book as a bible for people undergoing breast cancer treatment (though it is that). she talked about it as a a kind of lifeline--a source to go to for questions the doctors and nurses don't have the patience (or experience) to answer.

i hope you don't need a book like this.  but if you do, this is the one to get

158,"i found stale recounting of very well-known facts about 20th century technologies and their economics, with no insights.  since it covers the gamut from plastics to jet engines to microprocessors, and it's only 200  pages in a fairly large typeface, i wasn't expecting historical depth.  but  i was expecting at least one fresh idea.  i bought it on the strength of a  much earlier book by nathan rosenberg (about technology in the economy of  the 19th century).  i was disappointed.  i get the feeling the book is  intended as a brief survey for people who just came down in the last shower  -- college freshmen born in the 1980s.  i'll bet they find it kinda stodgy
"
26,"i'm almost finished reading this book, and what a long, fun ride it's been.  wordy, and a little confusing, this book has to be taken in the right mood, or else you'll miss the humor.

the places that the main character travels to are memorable and exciting, and i found myself getting through a hefty portion, without thinking that i had ever started.

some....no, more like most of the satire is cryptic, and hard to find.  however, i read up on the book, and it immediately popped out at me, and made alot more sense.

this is an excellent book, that i'm sure you will enjoy.  it might even suit as a read-aloud story for younger children
"
145,"this is the book that trackers and naturalists have needed for a long time.  it's finally here and it's outstanding!  now when i take apart an owl pellet i'll be able to determine what the owl was eating, and hence what small wildlife is abundant in that area.  and when i'm out and discover part of a skull from a mammal, bird, amphibian, or reptile, i'll be able to find what that is too.  mark elbrock has done it again: an instant classic, and a book that all trackers and naturalists should have in their collection
"
70,"i have enjoyed many of mark's novels (do you know that i love you is my favorite of the bunch), all the time recognizing his severe limitations as a writer.  

every character in every roeder novel speaks with the same voice--all of them, and though his dialog is usually age appropriate for his teen characters, his narrative passages invariably sound as if they were written by someone decades older.  there is frequent repetition and redudancy; characters never say anything once if they can say it two or three or four times (though he has definitely improved since his mediocre first novel ancient prejudice, which had the unfortunate distinction of glamorizing teen suicide).  his characters always (and i mean always) mate for life, which is a beautiful romantic ideal, but ultimately can get tiresome (gay teens are no different from straight ones in their need to play the field a bit before a lifetime commitment).  

all that said, at his best (dykwik, a better life, keeper of secrets) mark roeder writes a compelling and often un-put-downable story.  

but in outfield menace, the bad most definitely outweighs the good.  did mr. roeder do any research into the time period???  the fifties are certainly a good setting for a gay teen novel (if only as an educational experience for contemporary teens, who don't realize how impossible it was to be gay at that time), but if you want to set a novel in the fifties, don't have a lead male character with a ponytail.  no one, but no one, wore a pony tail in the fifties (and certainly not in a small midwest town).  don't have characters use anachronisms like ""fifteen minutes of fame.""  and most of all, don't have characters behave and think in anachronistic wasys.

mark roeder illustrates the dangers of self publishing.  he has apparently made a name for himself (and some money i'd guess), and i must confess, i've bought his novels (glutton for coming out stories that i am) but no legitimate house would publish his novels, at least not without major editing and rewriting, something that a self published author (especially one with an apparently inflated self image) goes without.  

there has been a renaissance in quality gay teen fiction this past year or two.  major publishers have put out such superb young adult novels as totally joe, m or f?, the hookup artist, rainbow road, boy girl boy.  read them, if only to see how these truly outstanding (and published by legit houses) novels could teach mark roeder a thing or two.  

if you must read roeder, then stick with his better novels and avoid this serious misstep.  memo to roeder: if you want to write about a time you don't know about, do your research
"
157,"the author keeps referring to the lds church as a cult. by definition a cult is: a religion or religious sect generally considered to be extremist or false, with its followers often living in an unconventional manner under the guidance of an authoritarian, charismatic leader.
in christ's day many would have considered his movement (christianity) a cult by definition and now it's the largest religious form of worship in the world. so let mormons do their thing. there's upwards of 12,000,000 of them now so i guess they're not a cult anymore
"
318,"the chocolate war

the chocolate war was one of the best books i have ever read...not! the chocolate war portrayed a very inappropriate scene. the boy jerry was supposed to sell chocolates but refused, but the book sidetracks and talks about naughty things and also swears a lot. i would not recommend this book because it seemed inappropriate. i don't think that this book should be available to children at a middle school level. this story might be better if the bad words and other bad things war taken out. i think that the story line seems great when jerry denies selling the chocolates because of archie. archie is a suspicious character that knows every one. i wish this book was more school appropriate, but it isn't and was a horrid book. therefore, this book would be great if the author published a book with the sam story but more school appropriate situations and words
"
722,"for the most part, the author seems to have pretty  good information for the time of the book's printing, but for anyone who wants to read this book on purely scientific terms, be warned; there are several places where the  book goes awry, for example: the author states that tracks of tyrranosaurus  indicate that it was a solitary animal, occasionally hunting in pairs.  problem: no  tracks of a t. rex have been discovered to date, a decade and  a half after the writing. aside from that and a few other points, though,  the book is good reading
"
1145,"this is a great book for someone who is getting a new cat or has a cat but doesn't understand him/her.  
i was expecting some new information about a ""secret language"".  there was no mention of the latest research in feline behavior and the author describes training a cat like training a dog; so what's the ""secret""?
i agreed with almost everything in the book except the comment about cat owners who leave on a trip.  the author says that cats do not get lonely.  well, that's wrong.  he also says that a cat will go to the home where the best food is served.  how does one explain cats who live with homeless street people?  
the title was deceiving
"
325,"this book really wasn't at all what i was expecting, or what the title would lead one to believe. the subtitle, ""in search of grace o'malley and other legendary women of the sea,"" makes it sound as if this will be a biographical account of the life of grace o'malley, with supplemental information on other historical female seafarers. not so. the first two chapters are devoted to the famous pirate queen herself, and sjoholm only provides the skimpiest bits of information. i knew almost nothing about grace o'malley going into the book, and i know little more than that now. the other women included are discussed in even sparer detail, and most of them aren't even real historical figures, but legendary story characters and mythological creatures like mermaids. she even talks about pippi longstocking! not what i was expecting at all...

""the pirate queen"" is actually devoted far more to sjoholm's travels in search of information on female women of the sea than it is to the information itself. i learned more about sjoholm and her own life than about the women she supposedly set out to study. she describes the inns she stayed at, the weather, the tourists she met, her own childhood, the abundance of ""personal bath mats"" in northern european hotels... almost everything but grace o'malley and her cohorts. in fact, the primary underlying theme in the book seems to be how the author came to the decision to change her last name from wilson to sjoholm; a story which, to be quite honest, i really couldn't care less about. i bought the book hoping to learn about interesting historical figures. it turned out to be a travel memoir, and a comparatively uninteresting one at that.

this is a shame, really. sjoholm includes just enough information on the various historical women she mentions - grace o'malley herself, bessie millie, janet forsyth, christian robertson, eliza fraser, isobel gunn, betty mouat, freydis eiriksdottir, skipper thuridur, trouser-beret, alfhild, the ""herring lassies,"" and numerous mythological characters - to whet my appetite, but then fails to deliver a full, satisfying portrait of any of them. she raises more questions than she answers, and i'd need to buy numerous additional books to find all the missing information. you may also notice, given the names, that nearly all the women mentioned are northern european in origin. sjoholm entirely omits women seafarers active in other parts of the world, such as the famous pirates anne bonney and mary read who, though from europe, sailed the caribbean.

as for sjoholm's writing style, the book is an easy read, but not a very enjoyable one. sjoholm's writing is given to an abundance of nearly nauseating metaphors. for example: ""the lava fields looked like vanilla cake batter poured over thick jumbles of dates, walnuts, and chocolate chips. in the sun the moss could also look like lemon yogurt spooned generously over granola"" (pg. 222). flowery, gratuitous, and often ridiculous images like this are to be found in almost every paragraph... peppered throughout the book like poppyseeds in a muffin, you might say... it's not the worst book i've ever read, but i do wish i'd spent my money on something else. it doesn't deliver what it promises, and there are plenty of more interesting and informative books out there to pick up instead

36,"this book is out of rint for one reason, it is terrible.  i am no lover of big companies but the author is so biased in this book it is hard to believe anything she says.  she blames p&amp;g for the destruction of the  environment, mistreating employees, the role of women in society and  racism.  p&amp;g has done many things wrong, most big companies have, but  it is not the cause of the fall of western society

392,"seven times the sun is not for everyone. it could be a springboard, offering times of the day and night where parents might want to incorporate some kind of rituals to provide their children with a stable and balanced life. but the songs, poems and traditions offered in shea darian's book are hokey and contrived at best, cumbersome and artificial at worst. none of the other reviews indicated the religious or spiritual aspect of the book. darian is a minister, and all of the poems and songs have a subtle religious bent. true, parents should teach children to be thankful for all they have. but i'm just thankful amazon has a customer-friendly return policy

1827,"i admit, i haven't finished this book.  a friend recommended it to me as i have been having problems with insomnia.  i was interested in reading a book about women's health issues and this one sounded intriguing until she started in with her tarot cards, interest in astrology and angels.  granted, i am not a firm believer in just ""the hard facts"" but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense isn't alternative enough for her!

1300,"i have read almost all of the works in the past masters series. this is by far the worse. i do not ordinarily write about books i do not like. but this work truly deserves a bad word. it is not about shakespeare , but rather about germaine greer. she simply did not do the assignment that she was given
"
391,"this is by far my favorite novel by forster, and many rereadings have made it one of my favorite novels, period. in his first book, forster shows a subtlety and lightness of touch which i, at least, feel that he lost as he  got more self-consciously &quot;philosophical&quot; in later books like  howard's end and a passage to india. he makes wonderful use of the italian  settings and of italian art, bringing them to vivid life, undermining  tourist cliches, and weaving them gracefully into his main themes.  no  other book i know balances romanticism and irony so perfectly
"
37,"i have yet to read a true grisham thriller, but i plan to in the near future.  having said that, i have no idea how this compares, but i didn't really care for it.  it's cute and has a sort of slapstick humor that i couldn't get into.  i felt like i was reading a teen or children's book, and i don't like feeling so patronized when i read unless i knowingly pick up a picture book ready for the simplicity of a good message--even then, i don't usually feel patronized or ""written down to"".  it's simple writing and a simple plot.  it's lighthearted and thus a light read.  i imagine many people would enjoy it; i just couldn't get into it.  :o

1446,"so many books on the market about pregnancy focus on the medical aspect of what is growing in your wife's little belly, and not how that little thing is changing your wife and life forever! this book describes to a 't' how this life changing event reeks havoc on everyone involved in the process, and it does it in a way that is bust-a-gut funny. before i read this book, i was like ""what the heck is wrong with my wife?""  after reading this book, i was more like ""ohhh, i know why she just ripped my head off... she hates the smell of carrots!""  great book, fast and fun read, a must read for a new dad. i've bought it for every father to be, and they in turn have done the same.
"
252,"this book is poorly written and even more poorly edited. the back cover states ... ""every subject is given background and basic exercises to allow beginners to figure it out."" it is a great statement, but it is unfortunately not true.

page 6: ""so what formats can a script be saved as? there are three main kinds of script files: regular compiled script, which is the native applescript file format, and scripts saved as plain text or as applications. on top of that, os x added a new option for saving compiled scripts and script applications called ""bundle."" bundles are folders that appear and behave as files. you can read about them in chapter 23."" - i guess bundle is not a ""main"" format? why is there a distinction between main formats and, for lack of a better term, minor formats? i have no idea. 

page 35: ""every class has a super class.""
page 40: ""we saw that objects belong to classes, and classes may have subclasses and super classes."" - which sentence is correct?

page 43: ""when you work with an application that doesn't support the whose clause, you have to settle for slower, clumsier repeat loops."" - repeat loops are not explained earlier in the book. there is no reference on this page to the repeat loops that are explained extensively in chapter 11, pages 321-343.

i wanted to like this book, but i do not. i look forward to a revised first edition or new second edition of this book, because it does have potential to be great. however the next edition needs more polished writing and meticulous editing

195,"i tend to like just about anything that brubaker writes.  while i'm not as excited about his marvel work as most others are, i have enjoyed his runs on captain america and daredevil.  his work outside of marvel has been great; sleeper is one of my favorite series over the last few years.  in general, brubaker had not written anything that i genuinely disliked.  then came 'deadly genesis'.

in short, this is a weak story with several plot holes which makes a mockery of a franchise that already has a history of reworking established continuity to poor results.  to what end?  another summers brother who is completely disinteresting, another story in which professor x acts like a jerk, a dead x-men (for absolutely no good reason), and some horrible reworking of existing long running history to cram it all in which now require secrets to have been kept by several key characters for the last 30 years.

i want to think that this story was driven by editorial mandate.  unfortunately, this is the second instance in which brubaker has went back and altered marvel history from long ago.  in captain america, he made it so that bucky never really died in world war ii.  this initially rubbed me the wrong way, but the story itself was done well, and the surrounding plots were good, so i begrudgingly went along for the ride.  i was still able to enjoy his entire run on the book.

his attempt to revise history doesn't work nearly as well here.  the key difference is that bucky had been considered dead for so long that there was very little continuity to adjust.  he hadn't been written into any stories during all that time, so it was very easy to go and insert an alternate history for him.  in 'deadly genesis', brubaker inserts events into key storylines from 30 years ago.  in order for them to work, the reader needs to believe that several key characters has kept these events a secret from that time forward.  it just doesn't work.

to make matters worse, none of the characters' motivation for anything makes any sense at all.  characters are keeping secrets, and other characters are upset with that, and through the whole you never understand why.  it's as if brubaker had an end goal in mind, and simply crammed in any plot device necessary to get from point a to point b - even if it required characters to act contrary to their nature or the story didn't make complete sense.

that aside, another difference between the two is simply that this series is not written as well as captain america.  they overall plot doesn't make complete sense and the characters are presented fairly shallowly.  reading it was more of a chore than an act of enjoyment.

the interior art is nice, though not great.  unfortunately, the book falls so short on story alone that the art warrants almost no consideration

1046,"i am in the planning stages of a new business venture. i have never written a marketing plan before and needed some insight and advice as to what tactics work and how to write the plan itself.

this book reads like a list of useful one-liner marketing tips and examples of how the author's friends have used them.  it is not a how to book on writing a marketing plan, and it does not go into much depth as far as how you might accomplish the things that he recommends. 

the most annoying part of this book is that every other page contains an advertisement for you to join some 12-week commitment mailing list that the author has created.  he entices you by saying that you will receive additional tips and information for 12 weeks.  

hello!!! mcfly!!! didn't i just buy your book so that i could learn your marketing insights?  yes!  so then why do you make it seem like i just paid for the teaser information, and that the good stuff is behind the curtain that requires me to become a pawn in your marketing career?  my price of admission stops at the price of this book, and it should not seem like i'm only getting half of the story that i paid for!

"
75,"this is a cleverly constructed book of several parts and a few recurring motifs. jones, a welsh methodist, everton fc supporter, london hack and oxford (arts?) graduate, goes to live in parma, italy where his beloved has established herself. he divides his book into nine separate chapters and tries to weave them together as well as his excellent english and his motifs will allow. the first chapter discusses nuances of the italian language and he uses those nuances to propound that italy is a much more nuanced country than england and that its culture is infinitely more refined. an entire chapter brings the nuances of italian culture to bear on football and he waxes very lyrical about the local youth and whatever immigrants are around playing ball as the sun goes down. the football allows us to place italian village life in our minds and to empathize very much with it.
the last chapter is an entire ode to italy. it is written largely in  the second person and it tells of ""you"" going through the village and everything there appealing to the aesthetic in ""you"". the english is beautiful and it achieves its purpose in making you close the book with a warm glow. mission accomplished.
the chapter on italy's catholic religion and its protestant and other minorities could have done with much improvement. italy's catholicism is more complicated than the padre pio cult and the protestants of the north surely have their faults as well. the chapter looks like it came from several previous publications he wrote.
the politics chapters build on the hypothesis that the fascist and proto communist factions are still at war with each other and that politicians like berlusconi exploit this for their own nefarious ends. he does a good job of tying the warring world war two factions in with the protagonists and antagonists of later squabbles. he does not like berlusconi and his polished prose does not quite hide this fact.
my opinion of this book is that jones sat down with his material and tied it all together into a very passable but rather superficial book which is nevertheless well worth the money being charged. 
"
1425,"polanyi sets forth an incredibly relevant, radical, and all too plausible theory in this book.

going beyond a mere analysis of how the market system functions, polanyi endeavors to answer the question as to how the market came about. polanyi's answer will not be pleasing to libertarians, he argues that a free land and labor market can only come about through government intervention, and must be sustained through further intervention. he also argues that the market ransforms the nature of social relations. usually, economic relations were a result of social relations, under the market, it is the latter.

polanyi attempts to show how a market for land and labor came about in britain. his argument that government ""enclosures"" created it through dislodging the poor and turning their land into sources of economic production is convincing. however, other arguments polanyi advances simply demonstrate a central government repealing the interventions of subaltern governments.

polanyi's argument that there was no ""rent-seeking"" (he doesn't use that term) involved in the enactment of state intervion in the economy (""proving"" that this intervention was objectively necessary is suspect. one 19th century investigators conclusions don't serve to overturn the implications of public choice theory.

the greatest problem with this book is that polanyi doesn't do too much to back up his arguments. he fortunately has a section called ""notes and sources"" where he lists his research material, but i'd wager that most of this is difficult to find 60 years later

639,"moral consciousness and communicative action is the primary anglophone source for habermas's writings on &quot;discourse ethics.&quot;  written in the early eighties, this translation, which was published in 1990, provides  a developmental perspective.  the focus of the essays moves from habermas's  statements about the role of philosophy today, in &quot;philosophy as  stand-in and interpeter, to his writing on reconstructive social science in  general, to his program for a discourse ethics in particular.  the final  papers address criticisms of this program.  the volume suffers a bit from  the fact that thomas mccarthy's introduction is keen to locate habermas's  position vis a vis various contemporary moral-philosophical standpoints,  but does not go very far toward locating the whole initiative in the  broader canvas of habermas's overarching social-theoretic project

1361,"i'm a big nora fan, but i couldn't even finish this one. by the fourth chapter i began to skim. way way way to much detail for me. which made it boring and slow. testing and corrosion, is it fake, is it real ...blah blah blah. enough! i did however enjoy the side story about the brother (i forget his name). but thats it folks. unlike all the other reviewers, i hated it. i say pass on this one. but as you can see, i'm in the minority
"
843,"this book makes bsc theory utterly accessible.  it provides an appropriate amount of background for those who do not know bsc theory well, but the balance of the book is dedicated to implementing bsc for almost any type of company (profit, non-profit, public sector).  niven's language is clear and thorough and his book serves as a step-by-step implementation plan for bsc

1052,"i have listened to a bunch of dean koontz books. while listening to the second one i saw so many similarities, which really turned me off. and this flaw continued which each book i listen to, which caused me to be reluctant to buy this book. however, most of the stories were pretty good so i stuck with him.  this is not the case with this book.  ""cold fire"" is absolutely horrible.  i so regret purchasing this book.  it is so bad that i have decided to swear off dean for looooooooong while.

just on a side note, ""the bad place"" is the first dk book i read and it was very entertaining.
"
1719,"herf applies a very simplistic test to determine the nazification of both germanies: did they side with israel in the middle east version of the cold war or did they not? the trial against paul merker in the east, which had as its background east germany's reluctance to pay reparations to expropriated jews, serves as his prime evidence for the continuation of things nazi in the gdr. but both of these arguments completely ignore the marxist ideology underlieing the rationale of the east german leadership and bypass more complicated issues of political allegiance. moreover, they totally eclipse the east german cultural discourse on the holocaust, a discourse that was decades ahead of discussions in the west and still proves to be more sophisticated than most that is being written in western academia.
"
1097,"the book i am going to talk about is the book arms and the man by bernard shaw. i really did not like this book because it was hard for me to understand.  the reason i didn't like it was because it was challenging for me. the english was hard to understand. i liked how the writer wrote the book and i would probably look for another one of his books. this book was more like an opera with out music. if i could have and known to i probably would not have this enthusiastic about the book. one reason i picked the book was because it was dealing with war and i thought it would have been cool to read about war, but when i got more in to the book it was really not about war it was more about a love at war. if you're an older audience it would be a good book, or if you're looking for a good love-war story.
"
607,"im not sure where to begin with this review, its not that the book was poorly written, quite the opposite it was a very good piece but it lacked any sort of luster or appeal. it was quite infact extremely boring, by page 300 i could not wait for it to be over and this is weird because up to this point i have loved the gunslinger series, they were all very good from front to back. there is way, way, to much about susanah and the whole thing about her having this baby and it dragged and draged, maybe this series is showing its age im not sure but one thing is for sure it was no wastelands or wizzard and glass. it was a far fetch from those titles and it had barely any excitement. it got to the point where i had to try very hard to pay attention and often i would find i had read a page and not remebered what it was about and had to read it again. im giving this book 2 out of 5, very poor story line, poor plot however it was written well i can only hope that the next book is better, cmon king give me the feeling wastelands did, blown away!! rather than tired and exhausted
"
242,"ms howard is usually a dependable author but she really let her readers down with this one.  it's ok to expect a reader to suspend disbelief every now & again but one would have to have a frontal lobotomy to buy what she is selling in this one.  so disappointing, especially after her wonderful & hilarious ""to die for.""  the trees (for paper) that gave up their lives for this book die for nothing this time.

"
708,"this book is a must for anyone who works with older adults.  it is a photographic essay of some very special people....people who embrace the robustness of life, and who are disciplined to maintain their capabilities as long as possible.  our world is steeped in ageism, that is, believing that older people are only capable of doing things that are &quot;appropriate&quot; for their age.  this book shatters those beliefs and provides living examples of people who continue doing what they love to do physically.  i wish that etta clark would revise this book with a new set of photos every year!  i have seen some of these photos over and over again in lectures that people give about aging.  it is a book to be owned, not borrowed

679,"this dark tragi-comedy resonates with the dramatic potential of hamlet, but and edge particular to jacobean drama. a play which is still relevant today (many students related it to &quot;the godfather&quot;), and brimming  with cinematic violence, lust, deception, vengence, and, with all this,  communicated through beautiful poetry

"
1654,"in his recently published history, the whiskey rebellion, william hogeland attempts create a revisionist history of the late eighteenth century whiskey rebellion in western pennsylvania. what hogeland accomplishes is less history and more diatribe in the vein of howard zinn. he has an axe to grind, and by the end alexander hamilton is the devil incarnate, and those who openly contemplated secession and committed acts of violence against property and people were just trying to bring the american revolution to its necessary conclusion.

the accusation that hogeland comes back to again and again is that hamilton incited the rebellion. the argument is that because hamilton's patently unfair whiskey tax was the impetus behind the frontiersmen's resistance, and his unreasonableness in enforcing the tax and issuing writs for the arrest of those who refused to pay the tax caused the rebellion.

the problem with hogeland's argument is his scholarship, or lack there of. he almost never offers a direct quote, especially when accusing hamilton of malfeasance. instead, hogeland offers his summary of primary documents with nary a footnote. the reader is expected to accept on faith the author's interpretation at face value with no way to check the facts except a ridiculously useless bibliographic essay at the end. not all of this is hogeland's fault. the new trend in historical works intended for the popular market eschews scholarly footnoting, opting instead for endnotes that provide little more than an opportunity to name drop. even doris kearns goodwin, a legitimate scholar, is guilty of the succumbing to this new endnote craze.

ultimately, this is the main problem with william hogeland: he is not a scholar. he is a magazine writer with an agenda, and no scholarly background to legitimize his preposterous conclusions. to read some radical agenda into the actions of the pennsylvania farmers is the very worst revisionist history, because there is no basis in reality.
"
86,"i have an amazon bookmark that advertises ludlum's book ""the sigma protocol"". it says ""in ludlum's latest, an ordinary man battles a global conspiracy."" well gee. that's the plot of this book as well. come to think of it, that's the plot of every book by the man that i've read. a 'vast right wing conspiracy' is set to take over the world. they have small armies, a lot of money and a plan. this time around, a group of military men (naturally) plan to foment terror, and use the chaos to implement their vision of the world (laugh not - millions in the middle east and far left believe 9-11 was something along the same lines). enter ""ordinary man"" joel converse. he's a vietnam vet and p.o,w. who thought he had left that life far behind. it's up to him to save the world. he will survive certain death several times (the bad guys always seem to think they need him alive, and they just have to explain their conspiracy to this total stranger). he will find love, and he'll visit several european cities to boot. of course, a suspension of disbelief is essential for many novels (how else would you believe that a nazi and an israeli are on the same side?), but ludlum's cliched stories are further worsened by the fact that he just couldn't write. his dialogue writing is always tedious, and sometimes just painful to read. action scenes are generic. the only thing he could do right is character background, but that's not enough to save this. ""the aquitaine progression"" might make a half decent tv movie, but to endure 700 pages is just too much
"
52,"talk about taking the joy out of an experience.  i read this book prior to a week-long trip to venice.  this book quite simply accomplished none of its objectives.  it is a poor &quot;guidebook&quot; and is poorly written and uninteresting in terms of a travelogue.  the history and art of venice are covered better in books from those genres.  the only upside is that it is short.  yuck, what a waste of time.  my advice is:  get a novel about venice if you like novels, a guidebook if you want that, an art book, or a history book.  at least you'll get something out of those--this one tries all of these and fails.  actually, in terms of a travelogue, &quot;vendela in venice&quot; far surpassess any other venice book i have seen.  although i originally bought it because it is considered a children's book, it is not dumbed down at all and adults will enjoy it...

1002,"most people will say that episode one is their least favorite of all the star wars films. but john williams composure for this one is second only to the empire strikes back for the entire star wars trilogy. this extended version is a must have, it contains all the music from the movie. the entire fight scene at the end of the movie is included and its wonderful to listen to. i wish somoone would do the rest of the prequel trilogy like this cd. a must have
"
890,"after talking to several pharmaceutical reps i know, i decided to shoot for a sales rep job myself. this book gives some very good insight into what it takes to land a job in the industry, what kind of people you'll be dealing with, what the hiring pricess is like (with particular emphasis on the interviews), and then what the job is like for people who manage to get hired. i'm very glad that i took the time to read this book because, after finishing it, i realize that being a pharmaceutical sales rep sounds like one of the most horrible careers imaginable. obviously this is simply my own opinion, and i know there are plenty of people out there who enjoy this kind of work, but nearly every single thing about it, from the superficial way applicants are screened, to the shameless pandering that sales reps must do on the job, sounds simply awful to me. if you are considering a career as a drug rep, you should definitely do your homework to make sure it's really something you would enjoy. this book may very well convince you that you would love it. if so, that's great, and i hope you are successful. but if this kind of work is not right for you, this book can be equally helpful because you'll find out by reading it what the job is really like. 
 
there are a lot of books on this subject on the market right now, and although this one was helpful, i have to say that i think insider's guide to the world of pharmaceutical sales by jane williams is far more comprehensive and detailed than this one. if you only buy one book, definitely buy that one instead. but if you buy two books, pharmaceutical landing is a good second choice.

one more thing: there's some sweet irony about this book that i just have to report. the author goes to great lengths describing how he scrutinizes every single thing about job applicants, from their shoes to their body language. he also stresses well-written resumes and cover letters. one obvious piece of advice is that job applicants spell check everything before submitting it. imagine my surprise, then, when on the very next page it says candidates should ""...right a short paragraph..."" about their job experiences. it seems to me that someone who is going to be as critical as this author is about job candidates ought to take the time to spell check his own book

"
1609,"this book is a very detailed starting point for renaisance fans. at its heart this is a socio-economic history. the clever inclusion of climate and geographic conditions presuasively explained why prosperous capitalism grew in some regions while others remained stagnant. chapter 5-""the human unit"" was the most informative. most facets of history are here for the reader to absorb. this is the type of book we all wished we had in school

"
777,"i respect the message of ""the unexpected legacy of divorce"" but it seems rather odd to call the ramifications of divorce ""unexpected.""  those of us who have been through the hell of divorce know full well the problems our children face as a result.  staying together for the children is one of the most damaging concepts of all times.  the author knows this and does present it in a way that eases my frustration a little bit.
i know many people who have divorced and not one was due to not being ecstatically happy all the time.  they fell apart due to abuse, infidelity, and just plain incompatibility. 
what i feel matters most for children is for them to feel loved and cared for by their parents.  when you have two parents who both love and share in the lives of the kids, most hardly notice whether or not they live in the same house.
when you have a parent who refuses to makes the children a priority, who constantly disappoints, hurts, and replaces the kids, there will be damage, no getting away from it.  however, is it better for this type of parent to have daily access to the kids, seemingly with the other parent's approval?  i hardly think so and will challenge anyone who differs in opinion.
it is impossible for any of the children of divorce to know if their lives would have been better had their parents stayed married.  this is  a major flaw in  the research.  i didn't see any statistics for custody or parental involvement which makes a huge difference. i don't think divorce is the answer for every marital problem but when it happens, you have a responsibility to make your children a priority and alleviate their fears.  when you put your own personal interests ahead of the kid's, whether it's divorce or starting a new life afterward, kids will suffer.
i don't like 'studies' like this, they're misleading and potentially damaging.

1101,"art is a young man fresh out of college, and has a curious set of friends: arthur, an attractive gay man; the enigmatic phlox with whom arthur works; and the distinctly odd hedonist cleveland. art is uncertain of his sexuality, being torn between arthur and phlox. cleveland is a threat to the stability of anyone with whom he comes into contact.

""the mysteries of pittsburgh"" was a well-received, yet while at times i found it entertaining and witty, in truth it's a very bumpy piece of work in which the characters don't really convince. the plot is unconvincing from the first, and descends into absurdity towards the end. in summary, it reads very much as a first effort, perhaps an experiment, but i found it baffling that anyone could consider it a mature piece of prose.

"
1515,"this is a nice compact hardback edition of dashiell hammett's five novels, which he wrote between 1929 and 1934. a veteran of pinkerton detective agency in several cities, hammett turned his intimate familiarity with crooks, low-lives, and the seedier side of life into hard-boiled, hard-hitting detective stories. this was a time when urban corruption was the rule, and private detectives, journalists, and police officers shared information. two of these novels, &quot;the maltese falcon&quot; and &quot;the glass key&quot; are american classics. another, &quot;the thin man&quot;, inspired one of hollywood's best-loved movie franchises. hammett's novels lift the veil of propriety from the subcultures in which they take place, laying bare violence, corruption, and pervasive cynicism. but they're not dreary. the sharp prose crackles, and the heroes stand apart from the corruption while swimming in it, steadfast in their own codes of conduct, their iconoclastic ideologies rooted securely in realism. these five novels all appeared as serials in magazines prior to being published as novels. &quot;the thin man&quot; appeared first in &quot;redbook&quot;, the others in &quot;black mask&quot;.
 
 &quot;the maltese falcon&quot; (1930) and &quot;the glass key&quot; (1931) are flawless. &quot;the maltese falcon&quot; features private detective sam spade, a irresistible femme fatale, and the ruthless pursuit of an ancient gold statuette. the last pages of the book are some of the most hard-hitting and cynical in all of noir fiction. and they're brilliant. &quot;the glass key&quot; explores political corruption that leads to personal tragedy in an unnamed american city. oddly, the detective is the right-hand man of a crime boss. &quot;red harvest&quot; (1929) features the adventures of hammett's most popular detective, the continental op, in a town called personville, or poisonville to those who know it better. the always unnamed detective for the continental detective agency finds himself responsible for cleaning up a mining town that is ruled by violence and mob warfare. the novel's opening paragraph deserves to be read several times. &quot;the thin man&quot; (1934) is an attempt at humor among new york's blue-blooded, cold-blooded upper crust. hard-boiled humor is interesting in concept. but i find the characters in this novel more pitiful than funny, and hammett's style was in decline at this point. at least his characteristic cynicism wasn't. &quot;the dain curse&quot; (1929) is another continental op novel. this one is melodramatic, absurd, and not up to hammett's usual standards. hammett fans shouldn't miss it, but others may find it pointless. i described the novels in order of descending quality. &quot;complete novels&quot; organizes them chronologically.
 
 five novels is a lot to pack into one book. but &quot;complete novels&quot; doesn't resemble a door stop. it's a handy size actually. the print is not too small, but the pages are quite thin. editor stanley marcus, a literary critic and frequent admirer of hammett's work, has included a chronology of hammett's life and several pages of notes on the novels in the back of the book. the chronology is informative and provides all of the apparently significant events in hammett's life. the notes are mostly definitions of colloquialisms used in the novels, which are useful. the notes also contain an introduction to &quot;the maltese falcon&quot;, written by hammett in 1934, in which he explains the origins of that novel's characters. it's quite interesting. for those who prefer to own these novels separately, vintage crime/black lizard hs published some handsome trade paperback editions. but if you want hardback and don't mind all five novels in one volume, this is quite a nice book
"
437,"boring, tasteless and unoriginal. photographer has an obvious fixation...which has kept him from paying attention in many cases to contrast, tone, and line. one star for the big you know what, the real model here. i'm sure book has its merits, but they aren't artistic. putting my copy up for sale
"
1715,"this book is more of an advertisement for scoblete's other books, his writing buddies other books, and his golden touch craps siminar. this book gives no mention of how the reader can acomplish dice control, which is the reason i bought this book. the book is rather a collection of stories. scoblete tells of people he met playing craps but he forgets to tell how to play craps. it would not surprise me at all if the characters in the book are made up, especially the captain, the authors ultimate craps hero. i couldn't even finish this book. it was boring and repeated the same type of uninteresting stories all the way through, and left the reader with no knowledge gained. if you are interested in a good casino book i recomend something by avery cardoza or a book published by his company
"
776,"this is the second novel in the mystery series featuring marcus didius falco, an informer and sleuth. a series of books that have become hugely popular, so much so that the author is now at the forefront of historical mystery writers. it was probably a stroke of genius on her part to have novels that are extremely well researched and contain all the elements  that would be and should be found in  rome in ad70, but to have a lead character who has the vocabulary of a present day new york cop.

in this novel the hero marcus didius falco has returned from the remote island of britannia, a god forsaken place whose people are morose and surly and the weather, well the weather is best left to its own devices. marcus has lost his heart to senator's daughter helena but is not sure that the passion he feels is reciprocated. why is that women he is not interested in, fall over themselves to get to him, but the one that he has lost his heart to, treats him with a cool disdain?

he has not long returned to the welcoming arms of rome before a series of fatal accidents and things that go bump in the night convince falco and the emperor that there are traitors still conspiring and they must be brought to book. falco is not happy, it seems he must leave his beloved rome yet again, but the conspirators are serious about their plans and will not let anyone stand in their way. will falco ever return . .

1139,"let me just say from the start i worship at the alter of richard meier, i absolutely, love his work.  it's so clean and light and refreshing.  this book does a commendable job of showing some of mr. meiers most recent work, i especially like the section on his apartment towers in manhattan, these small towers are as gorgeous as they are contriversial, and the building got a great write up in vanity fair a few years ago, well worth the read, anyway the text in this book is well researched and the images are first rate, let's just say that if you have any interest in richard meier or just great modern architecture then i believe you will not be disappointed in this purchase.  highly recommended
"
603,"i hate this book. it is extremely boring and it is way too long.  there are too many characters to keep track of and many of them are extremely similar. do not read this unless forced to. i like to read, but this nearly put me to sleep.  avoid at all cost

1471,"tolstoy's honesty at his own selfish motives and his dissapointment with the true value of his accompleshments is wonderfully refreshing.   his writing is so personal and open that i don't think anyone can walk away from this unmoved.  i was dissapointed that he rejects the concept of a personal active god in the conclusion of his search

349,"i have been planting flowers from seed in my home for almost 5 years now.  last year i had over 1400 seedlings on multi-level shelves under flourescent and natural light in my dining room. (boy do i need a greenhouse!)  so this book was not a lot of new information to me.  a lot of what is listed can be found on the back of a seed packet, but it's not practical to sit on the floor of my favorite garden supply store and read every seed package for suggestions before i buy it.  (this is important, because i'm not interested in refrigerating my seeds 3 weeks before i plant them or doing other such preparations required for some seeds.) one major thing missing from this book was photography.  there were drawings, but i'm sorry to say that they were mostly a way of breaking up the monotony of the text rather than a reference tool.  on the good side, this book did an excellent job of providing the proper germination environment, and each plant had a quick reference in a shaded box that listed the type of plant (annual, perennial, etc), its hardiness zone, and its flowering season.  this allowed me to quickly eliminate the plants that were inappropriate for my zone.  the regular index wasn't very useful, but one wonderful addition was an index of the common &amp; latin names.  i refer to this when looking at some of my books that include the full color photography i was missing.  (almost makes up for it....almost!) of course, there is the standard hardiness zone map, but they also added a map each for the probable first and last frost dates.  (nice!)  also included was a directory of seed companies and their addresses.  all in all, this book does a good job of covering the seed part, but a poor job of covering the bloom part
"
1344,"an excellent short introduction to the philosophy of logical atomism. the  lectures should be read along with wittgenstein's tractatus  logico-philosophicus. russell's logical atomism differs significantly from  wittgenstein's version of the theory but both share certain key features  which make the theory distinctive. those who enjoy &quot;mathematical  philosophy&quot; will not be disappointed
"
229,"i didn't like the only other dean koontz book i've ever read, watchers, but i enjoy reading kevin anderson's stuff so i thought i'd give koontz another try because i'm a reasonable person and i understand that not everyone can like everything by an author.  on to the review:  i realize that this book was initially meant to be a screenplay but i think the authors would have been wise to rewrite it instead of just tweaking it a little when the movie deal fell through.  the dialog is mind-numbing and predictable.  every time there was a car scene i could guess what kind of conversation would be held.  ""you drive too fast!""  ""are you my mother?""  over and over and over.  

the idea was good.  a modern-day frankenstein . . . or rather a frankenstein that had never died and had made it to present day (yes, i know, frankenstein was the doctor, not his monster.  but you get what i'm saying.).  but the dialog read exactly like a movie script would, or like a play.  this book had so much potential but the authors' laziness in not rewriting the entire thing after the movie wasn't made cost it dearly
"
473,"ageless body is deepak's attempt to neutralize the word ""old"" as in old age.  the writer has a knack for making common words, like ""body, ""mind"" and ""self,"" into profound concepts.  his technique is to overlay his abstract ideas with suggestive experimental studies.  but ambiguity in interpreting these studies abound.

	if you like poetry, deepak may be your read: ""the billions of changes occurring in our cells are only the passing scenery of life; (p. 36)""  or try to interpret this one: ""the emptiness at the core of every atom is the womb of the universe; in the flicker of thought when two neurons interact there is an opportunity for a new world to be born. (p.40)"" 

	at times he attributes to cells and dna a creative intelligence to direct their own construction and at other times his designer is invisible.  he would make a great spokesman for the current hocus pocus over ""intelligent design.""  he can't accept the growth of any cell, even a plant cell, without an intelligence involved.  he mentions and attacks evolution only one time on p. 115, asserting that the growth of a cell could never be a random process.

	deepak ends up in the very same thought circle as every other writer who tries to explain life in scientific terms: intelligence is a self organizing entity and every cell evolved is only intelligence having a conversation with itself.  whether your word game tosses in the word ""quantum"" or not doesn't change much.  what a solipsistic thought; what a solipsistic world.  i wonder if his readers who actually experienced the oneness deepak speaks of wouldn't, after awhile, go insane
"
1441,"i was introduced to this book while staying with a friend, and i was hooked.  i went home and bought it so that i could finish it.  i didn't know much about buddhism before i read this book.  ms. boorstein's stories read a bit like the chicken soup for the soul books.  she has short wonderful stories that demonstate current day people practicing  the buddha's teachings.  you do not need to be a buddhist to appreciate this book!  it's very inspirational.  since this book, i have read several more books to learn about the teachings of buddha
"
50,"i wanted to like this book, but i had to give up in the end. if the overall vignette concept is attractive enough, the execution of detail isn't -- kosinski can't write. he tries and eventually fails to convey what he deems important, whereas the reader is always expected to discover ""depth"" in simplicity. nothing to be recommended for
"
958,"more than human is one of those books that has garnered high praise from the science fiction community because of its strong prose and original ideas.

the writing is often compared to that of faulkner but i wouldn't make that connection having read a few of faulkner's works.  sturgeon uses many of faulkner's narrative trademarks (i.e. streaming conscious, first person perspective of low iq individuals, disorienting changes in first person narrative) but i didn't feel the net effect really compared to say something like as i lay dying.

i love science fiction books and the readers in general love the genre which is why they want it to be taken seriously.  this results in undue adulation and comparisons to mainstream books.  more than human is slow, dated and not what i would describe as genre transcending nor would i recommend it to others.  so the idea might of been original in the 50's but topics like telekenesis, esp, computer-brain babies, and self produced morality and ethos have all been tackled more successfully in other science fiction classics before (asimov) and since.  this book rarely set off that wow! button in my head or kept me turning pages.  this book simply did not have enough meat in it to make it anything more than mediocre at best.

in 1953 there were 5 hugo award nominees for best science fiction book (determined in a retro hugo award ballot in 2004)  the retro hugo awards are fascinating because the voting (in this example) takes place 50 years later so the impact of the book on society can't really be ignored.  besides more than human, the far superior the caves of steel, childhood's end, and farenheit 451 were among the other entries in a banner year for classic sci-fi.  needless to say, more than human did not win (farenheit 451 did and rightfully so)

bottom line:  i wanted to like this book and it doesn't surprise me that others give it such high praise.  these are probably people that don't read other genres enjoy congratulatory wankfests
"
841,"i enjoyed this book having read other non-fiction frontier books. however, i must say that the degree to which the author delves into how to make certain tools/objects, etc., i could have done without. i would skip through parts like those describing how to build a bean cooker, because such descriptions were so detailed.  if you're a technical/hands-on person, then you probably would like knowing how items/tools were built from raw materials in the frontier. but for me, i was more interested in the story, than the instructionals.

766,"leah stewart is a talented writer. i read this book after finishing her most recent novel, the myth of you and me (which i highly recommend). this story is dark and chilling. olivia is a young reporter covering crimes in memphis on a hot summer. when the body of girl is found, the case becomes eerily personal for olivia and the lines between professional duty and personal struggles become blurred as she gets deeper into the murdered girl's story and life. the characters in this novel are deep and well developed, and the sultry atmosphere of a hot summer in memphis is well rendered. i highly recommend this book

1859,"this is a very popular book, which is sad because it's highly biased. she provides evidence, but only uses the 10th that corroborates her story.

christian study maybe, christian fact, very loosely
"
694,"this book is pure fiction, nothing more. the problem is that is presented as fact - albeit little known fact.

i won't repeat the good points made by some of the other reviewers, except to say that i also concur with the criticisms of the book. 

it makes for difficult reading.  it really is not worth the effort, as you will not have any worthwhile information in the end. in fact, if you are a historian or scholar, stay away from it
"
1013,"this book is the equivalent of the proustian madeleine...to read it is to recover a past long lost. making the case for the mordant paradigm shift of us morals, ethics and literary tastes, this is the marker past which one can see the sad decline of the quality of art and life in the modern world. i cannot improve on the highly intelligent and sensitive overview given here by reviewer big orange ""paxbear"" and so will not review the book in detail. that it is one of only three saroyan volumes still in print makes the case for the obsolesence of the clear heart and clear mind in today's mindlessly kinetic world. you can read this book in the time it would take you to go see mi 111 in a cineplex. carpe diem. read this instead
"
1375,"like most of the reviewers, i went into this book expecting the humor and absurdity of the website. and it's all there, in it's ridiculous glory. however, this book is almost like two books in one. upon reading the footnotes a much deeper tale begins to unfold.
  beyond the nonsensical ramblings of robert, the book tells a tale of a lonely kid using ninjas as an escape from his sad life. his parents hate him, he has no friends, and nobody else listens to him, except his babysitter and faithful dog. 
  the further you read, the more you begin to see the deeper story unfold. however, even while the story gets darker, the humor remains, creating an experience that is both hilarious and touching.
   check this book out

693,"what a wonderful book. it's too bad so many readers today know only tom wolfe, not thomas wolfe. even though it has been at least 10 years since reading look homewood angel, i knew almost immediately when i came to the new sections. they add a depth to the novel, bringing in the whole town and relatives, rather being only about eugene gant. my favorite wolfe readings involve trains; the experience about time stopping for a moment when you look into the eyes of someone looking directly at you into the train, is exactly as i remember my earlier train rides.what are they doing now, that the train has passed? other 800 page books might be dull, but not this one.  having been given it as a present recently, i am very surprised and disappointed that it is already 'out of print.&quot; more people should know about o lost
"
1893,"this book is pitched, at least in part, to linux beginners. but it fails in small, maddening ways when speaking to this audience. after a lot of discussion of disk partitioning and install, page 65 tells you to run the ""man"" command in a shell session. it offers no clue that the only way to terminate a ""man"" command is the letter q - a completely unintuitive action. so a new user can flounder forever, or at least until they get frustrated and reboot. but i don't mean to slam just this book. that same problem exists in most other beginning linux books, even o'reilly's pocket guide. all these knowledgeable authors seem to think that noephytes will somehow magically gain access to information that the authors have in their heads, but haven't committed to paper. 

except for that, it's a very good book.

846,"as a long time admirer of art and a first time beginner of actually tapping my artistic well, this text is like having a private mentor guiding you through specific progressive exercises.  it's language is quaint and cozy to modern ears, having first been written in 1856.  but it is practical, clear and encouraging.  it dispells the idea that only certain people can draw.  and by focussing on drawing with pencil, it provides the foundation for using any other media.  a wonderful find
"
49,". . .uninspired and unsatisying. the writing style is austinesque, but the insipid plot and shallow character development are definetly not. margaret's motives and emotions are obscure, and the author's assertion that her &quot;heroine&quot; has wit and intelligence is never illustrated by word or deed. quite the contrary . . 
"
1878,"a quality photography book that visually recounts pertinent steps in the history of noir photography and more specifically, the creation of the term noir as it pertains to film and photography in the 20th c. in new york  city.  a breath of realism, history and fact that beautifully illustrates a  fine curatorial example of the kinds of images published by the daily news  that made this paper a forerunner in the telling of real stories suffered  and celebrated by real people.  william hannigan is to be commended for his  fine selection of photographic and negative samples of a time not long past  and still very alive in the movies and crime documents that inspire and  fascinate us today.  a necessary addition to any photo library of value

98,"it is over a hundred dollars but put it off this is the book. you won't need any others

182,"this book (i believe) is one of lem's earlier stories and it reads like so-so pulp sci-fi. fiasco (a true 5 star science fiction novel) picks up the idea of contacting a new world and does it so much better. i suggest reading this only if you are a lem completist (i've read all of his stuff except 2 books)
"
1849,"if you want to read a book that's exciting, happy, and mind-blowing you should read small steps. from the author that brought you holes, louis sachar, is at his best. this book is sort like a sequel to holes. the main character, armpit, is stuck in a situation which he can not handle. he is in the heat in austin, texas and i think it is making him do crazy illegal things. at first he did not know what he was doing was wrong, but now he just hopes he does not have to go back to jail. i think that this book is good for any reader 11 and above. both boys and girls would enjoy this book. i think they should make a movie out of the book; it would get outstanding remarks. this is one out of few books that i could read over and over again.

"
1778,"used this book all of the time in my german classes!  wish i had had this sooner, would have made everything a lot simpler.  its easy to use, easy to understand, and great when you need to find something quick.  this should be a book every college student, studying german, should be required to have

"
994,"on our beloved kay scarpetta and the illustrious ms. cornwell?  having been an avid fan of her novels from the very beginning, i simply cannot help but ask myself....is she really writing this stuff?
very slow in the beginning, i began to fear a repeat of the struggle that i endured to finish blowfly.  however, this novel does begin to pick up momentum...but not until the reader is halfway through, and certainly not until this author had left me sufficiently disgusted.  the storyline finds scarpetta summoned home to the scene of the crime...richmond, virginia, where her previous employer seeks her assistance in unwraveling the mysterious death of a young girl.  so scarpetta---with marino tagging along of course---heads back to richmond from her new home in florida to offer assistance; only to find that her old building is being demolished...and that the new one, under the leadership of dr. joel marcus, is sloppy regarding policies and procedures.  the demoralization of her former staff by dr. marcus is also unnerving to scarpetta; and clearly he resents her intrusion. so why has he asked her to come?
meanwhile, lucy, as head of the last precinct, is once again up to her ears in nonsense.  for such a brilliant, successful young woman (as readers have always been lead to believe), why must cornwell insist on making her so completely stupid in her literary life?  in this tale she is once again romantically linked with a narcissistic sociopath who also happens to be her employee.
worse than the weak storyline, and the fact that this novel is just all over the place, is the author's disturbingly sterotypical portrayal of african-americans throughout.  drug dealers are black, they're dead of gunshot wounds, and most ludicrous of all is in one instance cornwell references a dead young man's ""conspicuously large organ.""  are you kidding me?  the trash collectors are ""big dark men"" and of course in an upscale neighborhood, the ""old black woman"" must work in one of the houses.  the author's unbelievably narrow-minded, stereotypical view of other races is disturbing at best, and frankly makes one think that she may just be as stupid from a common sense perspective as lucy.

read only if you must, but frankly there are better ways to spend your time.

1266,"i am at the mid-point of the book and will likely post another review when i am done. [...] the authors give the history and motivation and design decisions behind hla. they also give many good examples, [...], allow you to get a really good feel for the important concepts of hla by running an actual federation. one thing i will be looking for is the impact of the architecture on simulation performance, scalability in practice (as opposed to in theory), and how is hla likely to evolve over the next couple decades. 
i don't know yet whether the book is enough for you to create your first federation. if you really have no background at all in simulation, you will still get a lot out of the first couple of chapters, plus the many references to articles written on the subject, but don't expect to find the other chapters easy. using my background in simulation systems, i can say that hla seems to have been very well thought out, based on real-life simulation systems, and is therefore not trivial. but that's what makes it interesting, and the book so far lives up to that

1499,"i had to read this book as part of a masters-level class on organizational management. i would offer it up for sale, but i intend to burn it when class is over.  unless you want to read a book written by people who are so much better than you are (he said with an extra helping of sarcasm), do yourself a favor and skip this book.  it a bunch of religous, self-righteous, fairy tale dogma.  horrible, horrible book.  will look nice when it's burnt to a crisp, however

"
149,"i have enjoyed many of mark's novels (do you know that i love you is my favorite of the bunch), all the time recognizing his severe limitations as a writer.  

every character in every roeder novel speaks with the same voice--all of them, and though his dialog is usually age appropriate for his teen characters, his narrative passages invariably sound as if they were written by someone decades older.  there is frequent repetition and redudancy; characters never say anything once if they can say it two or three or four times (though he has definitely improved since his mediocre first novel ancient prejudice, which had the unfortunate distinction of glamorizing teen suicide).  his characters always (and i mean always) mate for life, which is a beautiful romantic ideal, but ultimately can get tiresome (gay teens are no different from straight ones in their need to play the field a bit before a lifetime commitment).  

all that said, at his best (dykwik, a better life, keeper of secrets) mark roeder writes a compelling and often un-put-downable story.  

but in outfield menace, the bad most definitely outweighs the good.  did mr. roeder do any research into the time period???  the fifties are certainly a good setting for a gay teen novel (if only as an educational experience for contemporary teens, who don't realize how impossible it was to be gay at that time), but if you want to set a novel in the fifties, don't have a lead male character with a ponytail.  no one, but no one, wore a pony tail in the fifties (and certainly not in a small midwest town).  don't have characters use anachronisms like ""fifteen minutes of fame.""  and most of all, don't have characters behave and think in anachronistic wasys.

mark roeder illustrates the dangers of self publishing.  he has apparently made a name for himself (and some money i'd guess), and i must confess, i've bought his novels (glutton for coming out stories that i am) but no legitimate house would publish his novels, at least not without major editing and rewriting, something that a self published author (especially one with an apparently inflated self image) goes without.  

there has been a renaissance in quality gay teen fiction this past year or two.  major publishers have put out such superb young adult novels as totally joe, m or f?, the hookup artist, rainbow road, boy girl boy.  read them, if only to see how these truly outstanding (and published by legit houses) novels could teach mark roeder a thing or two.  

if you must read roeder, then stick with his better novels and avoid this serious misstep.  memo to roeder: if you want to write about a time you don't know about, do your research
"
1741,"this book is a sure snooze-fest. luckily for me i did not have to read the entire book for my undergrad art history photo class. we read selected chapters of the book.
they writing was horrible. many parts were unclear. i had to reread what i read over and over. i can't stand this style of writing. barthes attempts to come off as interesting and intelligent. instead, he comes off as boring and pretentious.
skip this book... try something else

629,"i had to buy this book for a class.  it is an extremely boring read and i struggle to keep myself awake while reading it (as does the rest of the class i am told).  it does tell you about dreamweaver though and i suppose that is its purpose.  one thing that i do not like is the way the author is constantly bashing internet explorer and other isp's.  his personal opinions are a real turn-off and unnecessary

897,"as someone who lived not far from brownsville in the 1950s and early '60s, i can say this is an exceptionally accurate book.  it is well-written and is the best attempt i've seen yet at explaining the phenomenon of the changing urban neighborhood.  not only does pritchett provide many well-reserached, well-thought-out answers but, just as important, he raises insightful, penetrating questions.  i highly recommend this book to anyone interested in american urban history, particularly as it relates to new york city

1037,"the author has her narrator(""cinnamon"") spend most of her time comparing herself to the fascinating scarlett,in a game of wish-fulfillment one-upmanship. even though she's calling the shots,as it's her book, scarlett still comes out miles ahead. perhaps it was only that way for a certain strata of society,but there was once a beautiful world of chivalry and gallantry and bravery and even some idealism-even if misplaced-just as there has been throughout the ages in other societies,such as ""ivanhoe"" presents.the story may have been one-sided,but it's the side mm chose to tell,and there's kernel of truth in the ""myth"" of the old south,as in all myths.

 margaret mitchell has nothing to fear from this silly so-called ""parody"",which is really a subconscious-or not so subconscious,in fact-effort to knock from her pedestal,that epitome of heroines-katie scarlett o'hara and the wonderful melanie wilkes.as if rhett would ever give any other woman a serious thought-he was obsessed with scarlett.that's why he turned to women like belle watling.and to imagine mammy killing the male babies,when she had been devoted to ellen o'hara from ellen's childhood.thank goodness this book isn't a pimple on the fanny of the classic gwtw,because what it is a a travesty-and not even a well-written or engaging one at that.gwtw will still be read and loved for all time,like the classic it is,when this book is selling for a quarter at garage sales.i didn't even pay that,thank goodness-the woman gave it to me,and i read it and burned it with the rest of the trash.i'd give it a negative star if there was such a rating.ludicrous and laughable-try again,ms randall,and try to get over the jealousy of scarlett and co. again,margaret mitchell need not fear,lol
"
569,"i'm on page 110 of this book. the book has 220 pages. i'm half way done and the author has not as of yet given me 1 valuable peace of information to help me forgive the person i am angry with. i bought this book because i have a lot of anger in me and the preface and reviews from other well know authors sold me on it with the belief that this book would help me. but, it is having the opposite affect. i feel i was duped into buying it (because of the promises in the introduction and the glowing reviews). part 1 tells us what a ""grievance"" is. it tells us, and tells us again, and again, and again. the thing is  i already know what a grievance is! i know i'm angry at someone, and i know it's not healthy, i know to forgive would help me.... i didn't need that to be explained to me over and over again for 59 pages. all that reading did was make me dwell and think more about the problem and increased my anger because of the book itself. when i reached ""part 2"", entitles ""forgiveness"" i thought finally.... but all part 2 has done is repeat what is in part 1 and what is in the introduction - how great the study was and how much it will help me. there are some great reviews of this book here at amazon and if this book helped some people that is great. but so far i can't agree with any of the positive comments. i have a great degree of respect for stanford university, i went to high school across the street from stanford and have taken classes there, but it pains me to have such a great school's name attached to this book. is it fair of me to write a review of a book i have not finished? no... but i'm afraid to continue reading it. i'm already angry and to buy a book that i thought would help me, only to find it frustrating me, i don't feel is not all that fair either......
"
295,"no intellectual can afford to be unacquainted with the immortal john dewey and his ""experimental school."" who would dare criticize the education legend inseparably linked with the irreproachable rhetoric of ""progressivism?"" i would.

dewey's conception of the child as learner assumes that the uneducated mind is essentially capable of directing its own knowledge by a spontaneous inquisitiveness stemming  from nature study. this he then expects to blossom into a more expanded consideration of the various academic subjects with the teacher merely facilitating transitions and answering the child's self-posed questions. the problems in dewey's model begin with his science fair-meets-museum-meets-playground-meets-lecture hall school design: the model is untested on any large scale and the cost plus upkeep is prohibitively expensive. classes are small and require several specialists and non-reusable materials. as if kids didn't have enough problems with the basic skills set already, dewey would have them heavily involved in shop and home economics. even more outrageous in dewey's model is the premise that we ought never force students to study what they do not like. their own intellectual prejudices reign supreme and by implication, teachers are discouraged from evaluating against solid standards. experienced teachers know that kids can easily hide their shortcomings even when required to study their weak subjects, and that remediation is hard to implement before they slip further behind. how could dewey's recommendation to cater almost exclusively to the child's intrinsic likes not further disguise and exacerbate low performance?

deweyism of course, like many other off-the-wall theories of education, denies behaviorism when it refuses to acknowledge psychological patterns in man. it depicts formulaic teaching and learning as fundamentally faulty and generalized curricula as harmful to student individuality. nothing could less representative of the quality research conducted, particularly project follow through: the great skeleton in the student-centered advocates' closet. i'd personally like to see dewey's updated plan for seamlessly moving kids, who come into class with their ""natural inquisitiveness"" programmed by tv, rap music, and other pop media, into colonial american history, calculations of hyperbolic asymptotes, tennessee williams, and the ""plus-que-parfait"" tense. but of course, such leaps of interest are unnecessary if we utterly throw out the old-fashioned academic corpus along with the old-fashioned school system.

90% of students in high schools today report that they do not feel adequately challenged. maybe the answer doesn't lie in yielding to children's lack of intellectual discipline but in tapping their potential to control that uninformed caprice. dewey's ""progressivism"" relies upon the contradiction of allowing uneducated mind educate the teacher on its own education. from the absurdity of it, i can only conclude that sane people latch onto this school gedankenexperiment to maintain an escapist fantasy in light of dismally high drop-out rates, lowered standards, and social discord. but a radical solution is not necessarily synonymous with a good one
"
1937,"with every grisham book i read, i get more and more impressed with his ability to not only use the law to create suspense, but to insert other elements to make this human as well.

for once, we have a character that is not consumed by financial gain.  however, this person has been left most of an eleven billion dollar fortune.  however, she does not know this.  a lawyer is sent to find her, and in the process, undergoes a fundamental change of his own.

this story takes place in washington, maryland, west virginia, and the rain forests along the brazilian-bolivian border.  in typical grisham fashion, he inserts considerable detail in all of the venues of this book, enabling the reader to create a mental picture everywhere this story goes.  you can picture the six heirs that are clawing to get their share of the millions.  you can picture the judge itching to have a high profile fight.  you can envision the rainforest, and you can picture in your mind the massive changes occurring in the life of nate o'riley.

this is yet another grisham work that will simply stick to your fingers like glue.  the pages literally turn themselves.  do not start this novel before going to bed, or you may have a sleepless night simply for the fact you simply will not be able to put this one down.

1197,"nine months ago i was hired to help turnaround a once successful business.  from day one i realized that this was a company without focus.  it's one thing to define a problem, another to find a solution.  haneberg's book was a shot in the arm.  just one concept -- ""stop multitasking"" -- would have been a major breakthrough for my team.  and, personally, the idea of doing ""one great thing"" has completely revitalized my approach to a huge job.  this book immediately rose to the rank of three or four ""must read"" titles in my business library.  in the couple of months since i first read it (and i've re-read it a couple of times) our department has moved far away from the reactive mode that drove decisions -- we're nailing deadlines, we're closing more sales, we're thinking more strategically across the board.  in a business and social environment that throws more at us day-by-day, hour-by-hour, this book is even more important than it would have been just a few years ago.  we're all doing more with less -- and this is a book that has helped me see order amid the chaos of conflicting priorities.  if it's true, as woody allen says, that 98% of success is showing up, then the other 2% is knowing how to keep your eye on the ball once you get there.  this is the manual for getting your business -- and your life -- where you want it to be

1730,"i read this years after i'd read catcher in the rye and nine stories and it was cool to be reading salinger again but it wasn't as rewarding as the first two books were. maybe i let too much time pass and outgrew his style. i dunno. i felt as if i was reading a magazine story and not a book story. i still would read everything he wrote tho if he released all new stuff, j.d. salinger's the man

79,"robert allen's previous book, multiple streams of income, is excellent and i can't say enough good things about it.  this one was a major disappointment in comparison.  he talks about the same rehashed internet marketing strategies that everyone else does.  creating email lists, newsletters, blah, blah, blah...

the most disappointing thing about robert allen -- and i lost so much respect for him over this -- is that he demonstrates how to get a bunch of people to order his product within minutes of putting out an email blast.  what's stupid about the whole thing, and demonstrates that he's a snakeoil salesman scam artist, is that what he's selling by email is a course on how to make money on the internet...so how do you make money on the internet?  according to robert allen, by selling courses showing people how to make money on the internet is the only way to make money on the internet.  that's a scam!  how does he sleep at night?

don't buy this book.  it's a waste of money
"
647,"at first glance this is a great book. however, once you've read it a few times you begin to notice the bottles of coke that feature in almost every illustration. the author, illustrator, and publisher should be ashamed of themselves. we all know that kids are exposed to lots of advertising on tv and at the movies, but do we really need to start worrying about product placements in children's books as well? this is a clever book and i was looking forward to sharing it with friends and exploring the other books in the series. the greed of those involved with this book have changed my mind, however

1638,"you get your money's worth here--there are a ton of cds in this audio book. unfortunately, i found bryson's prose (which i enjoyed a lot when reading silently, as i have done with his other books) to be greatly irritating when spoken aloud. to me, he sounds kind of 'affected' in parts, and sometimes there is a sort of ""moist"" sound when he pronounces words. hard to describe until you hear the cd, but trust me on this one. i think a lot of the positive reviews on here are for the book, and not the cd. i would stick with the written word on this one.

1504,"drummer hoff is an unusual story that uses repetitive phrases and rhyming to tell the story of drummer hoff, the man who ""fired it off."" in this story, a group of men are preparing to fire a cannon. each man brings something different. one man brings the barrel, one man brings the carriage, and at the every end of each stanza it says ""but drummer hoff fired it off.""
	this story uses childlike drawings to demonstrate the pattern of rhythm in the story. the colors are fairly bright which in turn give the story a comical appeal. the story itself doesn't have any significant moral element to it...it is just a fun book. the rhyming in this story is very catching and the pictures really make the story very humorous. by the end of the story the reader can see that the big explosion has just caused a big mess.

children will like the flow the story and parents will enjoy reading it aloud. a good holiday gift.
"
532,"many reviewers compared this novel to jurassic park, saying it was a better book than crichton's. what absurdity. i am not saying that jp is an awesome book, but it was far better than tyrannosaur canyon.

tyrannosaur canyon is a fairly intriguing story, but poorly executed and very poorly ended. it's as though preston suddenly realized that he was going to have to get his characters out of the predicament he had put them in, and didn't know how to do it. the ending is too fast, too unlikely and too unrealistic.

the book closes with a theistic comment by one of the characters, which i believe is preston's way of attempting to belong to both camps, having his science and being religious.

overall, i had high hopes for this book and i am sorry to say that in the last 100 pages, i was greatly let down

1476,"having had the delight of living in st. andrews and traveling over most of scotland playing golf, allan's book is the best i have seen, by far, for describing the reality of golf, travel, and living in scotland. he sugarcoats nothing, his opinion mirrors mine, and he is interested is ensuring his readers know exactly what to expect and know exactly how to best user their time and travel dollars. even with my scottish experience and contacts, his book is my golf/travel in scotland bible.

1357,"i have got to say that this is definitely the best cheesecake book ever. initially, i was shopping around for one since my boyfriend's favorite dessert was cheesecake. i ran across this and decided to get it. well, one of the best choices i could ever make, i think. this is an amazing book! 

starting from the recipes which are so numerous and so varied that they have to be divided into beverage-based, chocolate, vanilla, candy, etc., even one for light cheesecakes! honestly, deciding which one to try the first time around was the toughest challenge when starting out. well, i followed the instructions clearly,  as well as the first section on tips to avoid it cracking and boy, did it ever come out wonderfully! i never looked back. i've baked from it endlessly for some years now, tasting practically all of the recipes included. it's gotten to the point where i may soemtimes tweak the recipe and/or ingredients a bit and it still comes out great! my family has enjoyed all sorts of different flavors and many of my family members and friends have converted and use nothing but this to bake cheesecakes also. my copy is so beat-up from use, it may be time to get a new one. did i mention that this is also a beautiful book? full of wonderful (yummy-looking) glossy pictures.

my only (tiny) complaint is that on occasion, some of the ingredients may be a little hard to get but nothing too major and definitely nothing's that stopped me yet. 

i do have other cheesecake books which people have given me over the years but due to simplicity, astounding variety and plain old wonderful results, this is the one i recommend the most. 
"
502,"this was the only bertrice small book i could find in the gift shop of an airport.  that should have been warning enough not to buy it.

rosamund was an unlikeable character.  she left her 3 young daughters so she could ""make love"" constantly and then was oh-so-superior with her maid when annie did the same!  i guess being a rich, snotty noblewoman means you're not held to the same standards of behavior as the mere household help.

i found the love at first sight meeting to be flimsy and contrived.  small's readers are smarter than most, so i'm surprised she expected us to swallow it.  like some other reviewers here, i thought it was more lust than love.  it was clearly a mid-life crisis hook up for patrick.  and if rosamund truly loved patrick, she never would have left him when he was ill, memory loss or not!

not planning to read either ""rosamund"" or ""phillipa"", the other books in this series.  it was hard enough getting through this book, let alone another one with her uppity daughter.

the good stuff?  getting to meet patrick leslie again.  but it was heartbreaking to witness his grief over losing his daughter janet decades ago.  if you've read ""the kadin"", you know that janet eventually returns to her home, but only after patrick has died

1570,"nothing in this book was usable for me.  okay, very little.  if i was trying to write the next _ethan frome_, then this book would be perfect.  instead i write sci-fi and fantasy.  i was looking for tips to improve my description of things; this book recommends describing different things.  too much emphasis on metaphor (which is a wonderful tool but a tad obvious).  if you want to write in a way people might actually communicate, this book might be a waste of your time.  however, poets and pure-literary writers might find it more useful than i did
"
1368,"we are in the last part of the 19th century in this novel, and the wild west has breathed its last. the book is peopled with real legends (calamity jane, buffalo bill, sitting bull) and fictional curiosities (jim ragg and bartle bone - two mountain men, and no ears - an indian with exceptional eyesight). mcmurtry relates a sad, elegiac farewell to times past. the ever-interesting characters and their views of the world, which are wise and funny and fascinating, make the novel top-notch in the mcmurtry canon

223,"our book club read this book for our february 2006 selection.  it was a really good book, we were all excited about discussing it.  mr. johnson sent us discussion questions that really made us think.

a few members felt that denmark never loved sierra but saw her more as property.  the book definitely has some suprises that you don't see coming.  we really enjoyed the book.

835,"this was one of the first books that i picked up after my divorce 17 plus years ago. i knew that i was giving these men all my love, but even with all the love i was giving them they were treating me like i did not matter. knowing there is a problem is the first step and what a huge step that is. after reading this book the light bulb went on with a bang and it has never gone off. i have struggled with relationhsip issues, but at least i know what is going on and with each relationship i got better and better until i got it right. i learned i had to read the signs that i chose to ignore for some many years. i have been in a healthy relationship now for 8 years with a man that shows me his love(along with telling me)and treats me the way i deserve.
"
1431,"i've read and enjoyed all the starfist novels. this is one of them in name only. it starts like a typical starfist novel and even ties in some references to charlie bass and high level politicians but there the similarity ends.

i never did figure out what the author's point was except perhaps to rake in some quick cash. the men of the fist are hard working, hard fighting marines who trace an honorable history back to the us marines of the 19th & 20th century. these ""force recon"" marines are a ruthless bunch of screw-ups who could trace their ancestry back to the waffen ss.

rather than root for them i soon found myself rooting for the opposition. they invade a fellow member of the confederation, screw-up their primary assignment, fail to get the info they were sent for, kill allied soldiers and airmen, murder helpless civilian prisoners, and assinate the leader of a confederation allied state.

someone should remind the authors that recon is about getting accurate, timely, information. it's not about blowing things up.

i really wasted my money on this book, i definitely won't be the first lemming off the cliff the next time these authors have something to peddle.
"
144,"i am a jew living in a college town in mississippi for the past 5 years. i was born & raised in the north. i think evans should rename his book ""fiddler on the roof in the south"". his book is a very nostalgic look back at jewish history - as it was in the past here. it's very much: the southern jews were all so happy, they all fit in and were accepted, etc. he does cite a few instances where they had problems - but these usually involved us 'yankee jews', like the instances when a few (yankee)rabbis in the south fought for civil rights. 
evans should realize that times have really changed here! the evangelical christians in my town (which is most people here) harrass me like crazy - 'i am praying for you!' 'have you read the words of jesus, who was a jew like you?' 'when will you come to my church'. blah, blah, blah. thank god for the minority of catholics, methodists, presbyterians and a few others who live here. they are the only ones to accept me for the way i am, and the way i will stay - a jew. 
i want all who are reading this to realize that i am only speaking for my experience. jews who reside in cities in the south have told me that they have had far better experiences, and that they cannot relate to what i am saying.
but i do want to ask evans a few questions:
1) if things are so great for the jews in the south: why have you lived in new york for decades now???
2) why don't you at least write either a new forward to the book, a magazine article, etc., contrasting some of the ways in which the lives of jews in the south have changed over time (for some of us at least), primarily due to the rise of the evangelical christians?
i read evans' books before i moved here, and nothing much he describes in his books is my life here. for a jew who really cares about her/his religion living here is depressing; it is practically jew-less; and, at best, the majority of a certain denomination of christians here ignore me. (by the way, i am planning to move to a city!)
by the way, don't bother writing to me to tell me that i am ""wrong"", or to invite me to things like the bible study at your church. believe me, with all the praying for me that is going on in this town, and all the myriad attempts to convert me, if it hasn't happened by now, as they say in these parts, it just ain't gonna happen
"
1897,"i was so upset after i finished reading this book.  i wish it wasn't updated and they just kept it in its original version.  if you are looking for a historical information of how the samurai lived and their values, this is the wrong book.  read bushido: the soul of japan.  the code of the samurai really felt like the code of the japanese business man
"
1450,"lately there has been a lot of talk about how great ronald reagan was as a president. this book shows that this is not even close to being true. under his presidency we went from the number one loaner to the number one debtor in the world. him and his administration sold missles to iran inexchange for hostages and then illegally took that money to support contras in latin america. under his administrations hands off approach wall street ran wild with illegal and immoral practices. all this happened while his administration held down the poor and middle-class while giving the rich more money. it is debated whether reagan knew some of these things were happening hence the title of the book. it is a very good read and easy to fly through the whole book. the only complaint about it is the lack of an indept description of the savings and loan scandle and the dredded star wars program. recommended for anyone intrested in learning what happened behind the scenes of this presidency
"
296,"there is little more i can contribute to this literary masterpiece--even though the essential structure of my review is clear in my mind, it will not be able to truly capture the magnificent splendor of this work. gustave flaubert was a conscientious literary artist who revised and perfected madame bovary with care. he worked on the novel for nearly six years, during which time he rewrote the manuscript several times, often spending days perfecting a single paragraph. the result of his painstaking creativity was a masterpiece that rivals the heavens with its beauty. madame bovary is a penetrating psychological study of its heroine, emma bovary, as she struggles to find fulfillment through a realization of her romantic fantasies of love and wealth. she exists in a dream world and longs for freedom from her middle-class humdrum lifestyle. flaubert's realistic portrait of the tragic fate of this complex woman is nothing short of phenomenal.

in perfect contrast to emma, flaubert introduces charles bovary, a proto-typical doctor who has no real talent or ambition and is content to enjoy the simple things that life has to offer. soon after their wedding, emma becomes disillusioned by the bumbling charles and yearns for a romantic interlude. flaubert represents the absolute clichï¿½ of provincial life with his portrayal of this undemanding, unimpressive, and unnoticed middle-class man. flaubert brings all facets of human personas full-circle with the shy, well-mannered, and well-liked young man-next-door, leon. with a slow-blossoming relationship with emma, leon leaves for paris to study law. upon his return--and with a little experience--the two become lovers. flaubert's portrayal of this dysfunctional couple is reminiscent of tragic romances of yore. thereafter, the degeneracy of emma's lifestyle is evident, and she is brought to the brink of destruction.

in madame bovary, gustave flaubert gives us a vivid and life-like glance into the reality and the mannerisms and the customs of small-town people living in france during the mid-nineteenth-century. flaubert's descriptions are detailed and beautiful--and paint a real portrait of the natural world he is describing. opening with first-person narration that sometimes shifts to third-person has earned gustave flaubert the reputation as one of the most celebrated and influential novelists of the nineteenth century

666,"i too read the ta for tots to my 3-5 year-old 30 years ago.  she loved it a lot so i've been looking for it again, this time for my grand-daughter.  even though the title is different from the original one i knew, i purchased it and  read it as soon as i received it.  bottomline: this story is _not_ the original one and i don't like it at all.  other than showing stereotypical happy prince and princess fairy tale characters (which i can live with up to a point), i saw bunches of red flags when i got to the evil witch, drawn with a full-blown ugly face ""who was very clever and devised a very wicked plan"".  unhappy because there are so many happy warm-fuzzy people around she freely starts giving away cold pricklies.  without enough warm fuzzies (we read earlier) it puts people ""in danger of developing a sickness in their backs which caused them to shrivel up and die"".  ouch.  so instead of embracing the wisdom of old women, here we have another story that villifies them (ok, i'm a psychotherapist also and know all too well how these images affect us all).  no, it's not funny, and there is no way i would introduce this book to any child.  the book also does not do a good job of showing clear examples of what warm fuzzies and cold pricklies really are, as the original book did.  too bad, for using images of ""warm fuzzies"" and ""cold pricklies"" is an easy way to introduce feelings and consequences of behaviors to young children.  i am returning the book.

1175,"this is a nice small book to take along in the car but i don't think the pictures are animated enough. my 19 month old son doesn't seem too interested in the book

1593,"i did not find this book very helpful. there is an entire chapter dedicated to which expensive pots are the best to &quot;invest&quot; in (it seems the pricier the better, and i mean several hundred dollars, i  actually went to stores and priced the recommended brands) and what kind of  fancy kitchen gadgets are needed to create gourmet meals.  i am not a  professional chef, just a simple housewife that enjoys preparing simple,  good-tasting meals for my family, the recipes here seem to be  time-consuming and complicated.  not much money to be saved here
"
274,"i had a chance to read this book cover to cover. all i can say is &quot;absolutely outstanding&quot;, short of calling it a historical masterpiece in the field. very rarely do i encounter an epidemiology or biostatistic textbook that reads so well. it is optimally reader friendly; the author appears to have such a talent in explaining some most sophisticated epidemiological and statistical concepts in such a simplified language. yet he does not sacrifice the inclusion of some very advanced epidemiological and statistical concepts. new concepts such as causal graphs and instrumental variables are also included and explained beautifully. i strongly recommend this book to all early to intermediate graduate students majoring in epidemiology. established epidemiologists may wish to read this book to refresh and update their knowledge. i hope the author writes more textbooks with the same style

327,"i loved this book. the food was really good and fast (which is good because i have a very packed schedule). also great if you're on a budget. the recipes have variations so i could eat different things but not have to buy a whole new set of ingrediants.

the only reason it didn't get five stars was because some of the food was really spicy (i'm from texas, i like spicy), to the point my boyfriend couldn't eat it. i just modified the recipes and everything was fine
"
1209,"along with ""from science to god"" mr russell establishes himself as one of the masters of spiritual reawakening.  although this piece has more doomsday in it than his later work, it has the same hopeful message and the same readability.  

in both books mr russell never seems to lose the reader in scientific mumbo jumbo, even when discussing very complicated subjects.  that isn't a statement on his intelligence or research, but rather on his ability to communicate on all levels.  neither does he offend when he deals with the spiritual aspects of his writings. in short everyone can sit around his table (well, almost everyone). 

read'em twice.

1834,"this book started off very good, but as i read on the reading became ardious.  i found it hard work to finish this book.  i don't know why i had such a hard time enjoying the book while all the other reviewser thought it was the best thing since sliced bread, but i would read another shark book, such as shark trouble or close to shore rather than waste my time on this book

594,"in self-hypnosis for women c. alexander and annellen simpkins have created an instrument, a book and cd combination tailored to both the novice and the familiar practitioner of hypnosis.  the simpkins have masterfully crafted this guide to self-guidance weaving explanation and experience throughout the written and spoken words.  provided are tools useful in addressing a wide array of events familiar to most on the journey of being human.  
	while true to its title, self-hypnosis for women, offering examples of utilization directly fashioned to ""experiences"" idiosyncratic to women:  menstruation, pregnancy, labor and delivery, and menopause, the title of this work belies its more universal ""applicability"" to components of life common to both women and men:  self image; pain management; overcoming fear and anxiety, and finding personal balance.
	the book is prefaced with instructions on gaining the most benefit for individual readers.  those who may wish to skip over the more basic instructions are advised to begin their journey in later chapters.  those who are new to the practice of hypnosis, or enjoy viewing the history and techniques from others' perspectives are offered just that in the earlier chapters. 
	the story of hypnosis, and the modern history and research of hypnosis take the readers back to the early stages of identified systematic trancework, from mesmer, charcot and freud, to the contributions of hilgard, hull, and milton h. erickson; they then procede to accompany the participant on the journey through current and future directions, including their own paths, on which they are about to embark.
	the simpkins define suggestion as ""a process by which a stimulus is accepted and then transformed through unconscious processing into an action, experience, attitude or concept. (p.45)"" this presentation of suggestion sets the stage for an environment conducive to the development of a personal ability to self-guide.  together, the book and  cd promote the utilization of both conscious and unconscious processes as learning tools, assisting in the transformation from less popular emotions such as fear or sadness to components of life which offers guidance and assistance.
	specific hypnotic techniques, are explained, and accompanied by exercises which give the audience an immediate opportunity to begin experiencing and tailoring that procedure. the framework for these exercises is the suggestion of an ""experiment"" with that particular technique, creating an environment for the learner to safely attempt each new activity with no possibility of failure.  the only opportunity not offered is that of incompetence.  there is only a place to try, adjust, and retry each experiment until the reader fashions their own skill set based on personal significance and comfort.
	more than a ""bonus"" the accompanying cd is a work of art on its own.  again, mixing explanation with experiential learning, this auditory tool incorporates fractalization as a teaching method, to assist the listener in entering and returning from graduated levels of trance exploration.  a vast canvas is provided, upon which the hypnotic partner can create motor, auditory and visual experiences with encouragement and assistance, rather than direction or interference, a respectful approach not always found in ""self-hypnosis"" recordings.

820,"i have written software for development projects for 30 years and i have managed several projects. martin fowler has extraordinary insight, and i enjoy reading his papers for the gems of thought i find. 

the main lesson i pick up from this book is: break your large project into projects sufficiently small that you can sensibly abandon refactoring for each of the small projects.

refactoring works well in some cases, i suppose. refactoring works well for some people, i suppose. i'm skeptical, though. fowler filled the book with page after page of the detailed refactoring method applied to a problem he acknowledged as too simple for application of refactoring. he assures us that refactoring may overload small projects with methodology, making it unsuitable for them, and it works really well for larger projects. i suspect, however, that the burden it imposes enlarges as the job enlarges. fowler gives me no good reason to think otherwise. if i'm to risk this methodology on a large project, i want to see it perform well on a smaller project first.

fowler conceives methodologies that attract zealous disciples. in the case of refactoring, the methodology may succeed for its attractiveness rather than for its practical utility
"
1792,"amazing. one or probably the most impressive paintor's book i have. not easy subjects sometimes, but anyway, always beautiful
"
1869,"the author is reusing a similar plot device than in ""twisted"":  a somewhat obscure reference material that shows up late in the book and clarifies everything. that is a poor strategy for a mystery novel, because the reader expects to be given clues so as to be involved in the logical process of solving the crimes.
the narrative in general is not kellerman at his best, either. the characterizations are so shallow that one wonders all the time why the characters act like they do. 
a small part of the book talks about brazil, and kellerman simply invents a couple of portuguese words making them sound spanish:  (""favilla"", ""favillitos""). one wonders how much of the author's research is similarly fictional.
in sum, a book carelessly executed

1278,"for years, i had heard the akashic records being touted as the unwritten spiritual book of life, that included every event, every living soul who had ever taken a breath from the beginning of time through eternity. the subject was beyond fascinating, as my limited mortal mind could not grasp the enormity of such a body of knowledge ""existing"".
however, i took it on absolute faith that this was so and recently endeavored to find the quintessential book on the subject. knowing of mr. cayce's tremendous psychic following, i assumed this book would enlighten me and others. i excitedly bought a new copy for myself and sent another to a friend.
after trudging through the first 68 pages, i felt lost and befuddled. the writing and text are difficult to follow and not at all in ""layperson's"" language.
perhaps this book is meant for an experienced psychic mind and intellect, one who understands the language and is willing to muddle through the long-winded case histories to discover meaning and relevance.
my friend confessed she had read a mere chapter or two, then set it aside.

"
773,"reviewer alianore's opinion ""rather too indulgent of its subject"" is a very accurate portrayal of weir's work. i will try to add something to that near perfect review. (note: i listened to the unabridged audiobook of ""queen isabella"", 22 hrs on 18 cds).

the first half or so of this biography is mostly enjoyable, loaded with period details. the last third is the worst: weir's fawning dedication to a glorious rehabilitation -- nay, elevation -- of queen isabella to the role of long-suffering, much-wronged, highly-deserving, and late-redeemed just queen of england.

this book is really ""subjective, rhetorical biographal dramatization"". i do not consider it to adhere to an academic standard for objective history and analysis. it is rhetoric because of the endless ""weasel words"" (and expressions) used copiously throughout: ""some say"", ""it has been said"", ""many believe"", ""therefore we may assume"", ""it can be inferred"" ... this isn't just an attribute of her style ... it *is* her style comprehensively. these expressions occur many hundreds of times, commonly in conjunction with wier's subjective analyses that present her beloved isabella in the best possible light, always giving her every benefit of the doubt and shifting negative interpretations onto other persons.

equally irksome is weir's double-standard of historical psychological analysis. she is always 'declaring' for us the contents of isabella's thoughts. remarkable gift she has for this. many times weir reasonably states that modern psychological and socialogical interpretations of medieval history are inherently invalid or at least not meaningful. but then moments later she will portray isabella's actions from a 21st century point of view ... always telling the reader how isabella must have, might have, could have, would have been thinking and feeling about one situation after another ... often presented in a positive way that is only supported by a present-day psychosocial interpretation of 800 year old history. this isn't historical writing, it is historical op-ed, with an obvious agenda.

i don't loathe this work, it is enjoyable in many parts for its color characterizations and depth of detail. the narrator of the audio book has a wonderful voice and good pacing. but this is highly flawed in its editorial approach to historical biography. (other egregious examples of such hagiography include edmund morris' ""rise of theodore roosevelt"" and ""theodore rex"". i could not complete either of those since morris is so obviously enthralled by his subject, lovingly lionizing him in every sappy sentence. yuck. really.)

if prefer more history when reading (or listening to) history. and much, much less editorial subjectivity, retroactive psychology, biased interpretation and rhetorical postulation. the only way i could enjoy ""isabella"" by weir is to accept her bias up front and listen accordingly, taking it with ""several pounds of salt"" as the above referenced reviewer advises.

1685,"mere words cannot express how pleased i am with my copy of 501 french verbs.  very user friendly.  well organized.  a gem.
i am currently working between learning spanish and french.
between the two,i feel that french is the more difficult language.
now, how to speak the language.  the accent, sentence formation, idioms?
for all the beauty of this reference book, no one comes even close to equaling behind the wheel french for teaching you how to put all these verbs together and actually speak the language like the natives.
if you're just trying to get through a college french course requirement or never plan on really speaking the language, then 501 french verbs is perfectly fine all by its sweet self.
however, if you do want to do more than read french literature and plan on hitting the streets in france someday, then by all means, combine this fabulous book with behind the wheel french cds.  they also have a revised version for the same price that comes with a terrific book that is very instructional and easy to use.

1067,"the purpose of nessus is to provide an open source solution for network auditing on all unix like systems.  this book not only details using nessus but also comes with a cd containing the program, as well as ethereal, snort, and newt (a port of the program to the windows environment).

what is a network assessment?  at its basic level it is an attempt to detect a live system and then identify the computing environment, services, applications, and vulnerabilities on that system.  basically there are two types of assessment - internal and external.  an internal assessment is done over the local network and external is done from outside the lan.  nessus will do both types and the book details how to do either, or both of them.

the authors do an excellent job of detailing installation, setup, and how to interpret the results of a scan as well as various factors that can affect the report.  one of the parts not to be missed is the discussion of not only the benefits but also the potential problems of scanning your system.  some of the vulnerability types scanned for include buffer overflows, default passwords, backdoors, information leaks, and denial of service.

the nessus scripting language is covered in detail in appendix a instead of the main portion of the book; a choice i appreciated very much as it allowed the flow of the book to not be interrupted by such a highly technical section.  with open source products there generally is no organized technical support phone number you can call of help.  so, the authors include information on how to get help via the nessus user community, mailing lists, and archives.

nessus network auditing is a highly recommended book for anyone interested in auditing their network to find potential problems before they become reality

998,"i love heinlein.  i think that he has a unique voice and perspective in the world of science fiction.  i find that his plots and ideas are inventive.  even this story was inventive in many ways, like some of the business ideas in regards to the new source of energy in the first chapters.  however, i found this book as a whole to be very boring.  much of this is due to the lack of fully fleshed characters.  the &quot;main&quot; characters of each section of the book aren't fully realized at all.  i wouldn't recommend this book unless you picked it up for free and were really, really bored

1201,"this book is pretty much useless if you're looking for info on how to build a dulcimer.  only about 60 pages of it actually talks about dulcimer making/repair.  the rest is a long winded history/bio of homer ledford.  some of that is a bit interesting from an historical/cultural perspective, but the author beats it to death.  homer wanted the book to be just on how to build and care for a dulcimer; the rest was the author's idea.  dean kimball's book on dulcimer making is better, although still lacking in some areas.  this book has no patterns or plans, few useful photos, and is weak in what instruction it does provide.  there are a few useful ideas but not worth the price of the book

179,"i once read an article in horn book magazine (a review source of titles and articles on children's literature) that lamented the millions of poor translations of hans christian andersen polluting the minds of our young people today.  the review mentioned that stories like, ""the snow queen"", which were originally written in a snappy vernacular, have been dumbed down and drained of all energy by their american translators.  with this idea fresh in my mind i found myself in possession of a very particular copy of ""the snow queen"" and i was able to test this theory myself.  now due to the wacky nature of amazon.com, the website has lumped together the reviews of every single version of this anderson story.  you will see that some of the reviews refer to nilesh mistry's, some refer to the audio book, some to eileen kernaghan's, and some (god help us all) to mary engelbreit.  none of these, however, are the version that i am reviewing.  after careful consideration, i selected the edition retold by amy ehrlich and illustrated by susan jeffers.  the ehrlich/jeffers team has banded together to bring us every fairy tale from thumbelina to cinderella.  with this 1982 classic edition, they bring all the creepy and crawly elements of andersen's riveting tale to a kind of tame middlebrow life.
	
most people don't remember that ""the snow queen"" begins when the devil creates a mirror that reflects everything good as bad.  by a quirk of fate the mirror is smashed one day (the details of this accident are left unclear) and the tiny pieces go spinning into the atmosphere.  if these splinters enter your eye, everything will look ugly to you.  if they enter your heart, it will turn instantly to ice.  got it?  good.  cause sure enough, two small pieces enter the eye and the heart of a boy named kai.  when this happens he stops playing with his best playmate gerta and instead falls under the seductive spell of the mysterious and magnificently pale snow queen.  gerta goes in search of her friend but is waylaid by a variety of different adventures.  she escapes an overly loving old witch, is taken in by a prince and princess, falls into the power of a thief girl and her kin, and at last saves kai from the snow queen herself.  by the end of the book, neither kid is a child any longer and their home is just as they left it.
	
obviously ""the snow queen"" is one big ole story about growing up.  the idea of the devil's mirror causing someone to despise anything they see and grow a suddenly cold heart... well that's just another way of describing adolescence, is it not?  andersen obviously borrowed quite a lot from that classic old tale, ""east of the sun, west of the moon"", in which another girl goes off to save the man she loves from the machinations of a wicked woman.  heck, ""tam lin"" was probably an influence as well.  the best version of this particular story i ever read was by kara dalkey.  it was a tale named, ""the lady of the ice garden"" and can be found in ""firebirds: an anthology of original science fiction and fantasy"".  it is not, however, appropriate for children.  kids today will probably look at ""the snow queen"" and instantly think of the white witch from ""the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe"".  i cannot think, however, that this is a bad thing.  
	
as for the jeffers/ehrlich version, it's all right.  as an illustrator, jeffers has apparently decided to make kai and gerta definitely children.  i guess that lowers the creepiness factor when the snow queen lures the boy to her sleigh and wraps him in her furs.  jeffers really captures beautifully every diamond in the snow queen's dress and every strand of her white white hair.  there is the odd stylistic choice here and there, though.  when gerta surprises the prince and princess in their bed, it is not your typical mattress affair but rather large his and her flower petals.  i can't think that they're comfortable (or even particularly practical).  the illustrations have been created, according to the book, ""using a fine-line pen with ink and dyes.  they were applied over a detailed pencil drawing that was then erased"".  as a result, the book is as soft as a colored pencil, but with a level of detail and intricacy normally associated with pen and ink.
	
obviously i don't know enough about the original version of ""the snow queen"" (or, as andersen called it, ""sneedronningen"") to know whether or not this book is a worthy version to read to your tots.  at any rate, it tells the full story, warts and all, and will provide them with what may well be the most freudian-toned fairy tale ever to grace their little brains.  a fun edition of a rather odd tale

1394,"i have yet to use an actual phrase from this guide, but... it is good for re-charging my batteries when i have to write a review and feel uninspired.  after reading through some ideas in this guide, i usually find i can then find my own words to say what i need to convey.  the fact that all the phrases are positive, i see as a good thing because i feel it's important to have a positive attitude toward the associate you're reviewing.  if there are challenges in the persons performance, the manager should have been working with the associate on that throughout the review period.  i would recommend this book but only as a way to inspire the person writing a review to come up with their own way of phrasing... rather than use the phrases in the book. the people we manage deserve more than ""copy/paste"" reviews.

1682,"an elf appearing to harry potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. the chamber of secrets, he said, had been opened and a  monster is lurking. harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been ""petrified"" by the monster. age group interest: early teen. i wanted to see what all the rave was about. lots of action, not much morale.

893,"i really thought i would be able to learn about the philadelphia project from this book, considering the title. however, the actual project doesn't make an appearence until the last chapter. the entire book focuses on ideas that may or may not have contributed to a project that may or may not have taken place. 
this book was disappoiting to an extreme.
"
1362,"i read this book many, many years ago on a very long flight.  i couldn't put it down.  the philosophy is simple; live frugally, save/invest money every month, and you too can be a millionaire.  it's great advice, especially in this day and age when the younger generation wants the big house, expensive car, and everything else right now, with no regard to the future.  although some of the info is dated (enron being named as a great company to invest), and some other advice (putting new soles on old shoes) is a bit much, the general message makes plenty of sense.

1688,"all the reviews so far sound like personal friends of b.w. who are puffing the book. the book is simple and would require more information. so why not just go buy a book with more information.

1475,"having read this book as well as barnet schacter's on new york during the revolution, both works i find are flawed in different ways.  the likeable thing about gallagher is that he manages to convey the story in less than half the time.  the hard thing to realize about the battle of brooklyn is that it really wasn't much of a battle.  the author here makes some grandoise statements about a new age of citizen warfare being ushered in with the advent of this battle.  if that is so then the complete defeat of washy's army bodes ill for that development!  

gallagher is on better ground when he provides a nice overall of tactics and warfare in the 18th century.  he gives a good account of training and recruitment in both armies.  one of the more interesting things he mentions is that due to the two-rank line used by both sides in the revolutionary war, casualties from musketry and artillery tended to be light.  this is an interesting point, and one not brought out by many historians of the period.  in europe stronger lines of 3 and sometimes 4 ranks were employed, which provided greater strength, but also more density.  hence increased loss from fire.  a point well worth considering when looking at the battles of the revolution.  most historians miss this completely, or are not interested in it.  

gallagher provides more of a military history in general on this subject, but he does waste a lot of time with preleminaries.  more than half of the book is spent providing the standard background for the causes of the revolution, etc.  while certainly required for the general reader; when a book is as short as this one is it seems almost pointless.  when we get down to the battle itself gallagher gives us not much more than schacter does.  the british flank march completely compromises washy's position, the outlying forces are swept away clear and simple.  the confusion of command between putnam and sullivan no doubt made a bad situation worse.  washy's complete lack of strategic perspective shows up totally here.  the defense of brooklyn, much less manhatten itself was a foregoon conclusion.  washy was mad to consider defending brooklyn, much less manhatten in the first place.  he committed his ill-trained army to an impossible task.  that he did not lose completely was due more to how the british under howe chose to wage their campaign. 

most american authors try to put a bright light on what is essnetially a dark canvas.  at brooklyn the americans ran.  period.  a few units stood their ground, in particular the marylanders, but no one else really did.  the reason why american losses were not greater was because they did run.  some authors try to say that british losses in killed and wounded were greater than americans at this battle. this is true partly because the british had to attack some strong positions that held for a time until pireced by the assault.  british losses were often greater in this regard because americans usually ran once the british bayonet began to strike home.  still, of the 1,000+ casualities sustained by the americans here, more than most us historians care to admit fell to british musketry and bayonets. the british loss was still well below 400.  as the great maurice de saxe said in his memoirs of warfare in this period, more of the enemy can usually be despatched when he runs as opposed to when he stands.  to reserve fire until the enemy line breaks was considered the most effective tactic of this period.  in that respect many dozens of rebels must have been shot down as they ran before british bayonets.  

gallagher provides some understanding why the british did not storm the heights right away.  this has often been one of the major criticisms of howe's victory.  why didn't he follow up?  after marching all night to outflank the americans, the british were disorganized, and tired.  they had also foght a running battle with a fleeing enemy.  howe did not believe his army was in any condition to storm brooklyn heights, memory of bunker hill or no.  of course this does not explain why it was not done the following day.  if we look more closely at howe's position we can perhaps explain his rationale.  his commission was both a general and peacemaker.  he wanted to convince the rebels to come back into the royal fold.  he could best do this by showing how futile their resistence to the crown was.  to have destroyed washy's army in brooklyn would have been gratuitous, excessive.  such loss of blood would have defeated the purpose in mind.  in restrospect it is easy to find fault with this strategy, and it would prove to be the only chance the british really had to crush the revolution in its infancy.  

the battle of brooklyn needs to be looked at from several perspectives.  gallagher gives us a good start, but i think a more comprehensive work still needs to address all the issues here. 
"
729,"after reading the trilogy, i was left wondering what the hell happened? i have just read all 3 of the his dark materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker.
   pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story - one of the most creative stories i've come across in 20 years of reading fantasy. there isn't even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess. if you look up `anticlimax' in the dictionary, you'll see a picture of this book. from first page to last, time is wasted on boring characters, while all the good ones are either killed off, or just mia for the entire book. spoilers ahead.
  what about lyra and her parents? somehow, she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl? she never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations. and will just goes back with mary malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops. over a cup of tea, naturally. and that's it for him.
in addition to all that, this book doesn't even seem to be connected to the first two. none of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends, will and lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 . . .  all in the last 30 pages. what happened to the story, for cripes sake?!  and what happened to the `temptation'? was choosing not to stay with will her way of not succumbing to it? the whole premise is just so lame to start out with. as an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries didn't endanger the universe, why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give lyra and will a chance to know each other. the flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another. supposedly, they had more than gonads going for them, they survived death together!
  pullman didn't feel like thinking it through, he just wanted a gut wrenching ending. in addition to that, he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the `reality' of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning. all of will and lyra's efforts are futile, kind of like - guess what? religion for the rest of us morons. 

after having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa-elephant aliens or whatever, ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper. iorek byrnison, lee scoresby - instead we get page after page about mary malone the disaffected former nun. pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in him or anything for that matter!
  this is not children's literature, it's a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess. it's totally dishonest to sell this as a children's book, or even as a competent work of fiction. all of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one.
 
we never get closure on lyra's parents.
we never really understand what dust is and where it comes from.
we never see will reunited with his mother.
we get a lame battle where `god' dies and no one even knows why or how.
lyra and will fall in love, but have to `sacrifice' it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever, with only flimsy reasoning behind it.
the mulefa and mary malone's work together amounts to nothing, everyone just goes home. presumably, will goes home, although we never see it. all that yearning after his mother and so forth . . .nothing.
the major enemies are killed off too easily - and what about armageddon? what happened to the fortress and all the rebel angels and . . .you get the idea. it all just sort of disovles.
mary forgot to be the serpent, or else i missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa.

another reader pointed out:
"" phillip pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series. instead, the story falls flat under the weight of the author's own agendas and mockeries. what a waste of time. i can't believe this book actually won awards. it stopped being thought-provoking and started being inane and silly.""

 it would have been better if lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream. instead, relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the kingdom of heaven in the course of her lifetime. absurd.
this was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life.

1377,"i chanced upon this book quite by accident.i am a big fan of books which inspire.this may not be a book which is high on the literary quotient, the writing does get rambling and long winded quite a number of times.but whats truly awe inspiring is its straight up from the heart.its quite amazing that someone can go through so many emotions in a lifetime and actually make peace with all thats happened in a lifetime.

886,"the novel, a northern light, by jennifer donnelly, is a very realistic portrayal of the life of a teenage farm girl, bound for a great future.  jennifer donnelly relates to mattie gokey, the lead character, in a way that they bother grew up in rural side of new york.  donnelly attended the university of rochester before she wrote her three novels and one children's book. her novels include, the tea rose, the winter rose, a northern light, and a children's book, humble pie. all of her novels include a very popular romantic theme and her book, a northern light, has also been introduced in europe under the title a gathering light.
	a northern light reflects a lot on the issues of wealth, education, love, and murder.  the combination of those themes makes for a novel that anyone is able to read and relate to.  as you read this book, you feel like the main message is the traditional cliché of following your dreams no matter how hard they are to achieve. but as you read further, you realize that it's a lot about hardships, strength and love.  on the first page of the book, mattie is imagining a perfect day at the glenmore hotel before she so disappointingly tells herself, ""i believe these things. with all my heart.  for i am good at telling myself lies"".  from this quote, you can see the type of person mattie is, and it gives a foreshadowing to the events that would take place throughout the novel.  the events typically consist of let down after let down for mattie and her hopes for her future.   
	this book is written from mattie's point of view which really helps the reader to get to know her better.  it adds a different element to the book that wouldn't be there if it wasn't written from mattie's point of view.  it lets you get inside mattie's head and feel the emotions that she's dealing with along with her true thoughts and feeling towards situations.  mattie is truly troubled girl who works so hard toward what she wants and yet there is always something holding her back. she's stuck in a farming town where education isn't as important as having a prosperous farm and a family. as you read this book, you just want to tell mattie that she needs to take her own future into consideration and stop worrying long enough to have some faith.  she is a selfless giver who is willing to do anything and everything to keep her family and her farm doing well.  she deals with extreme guilt for wanting to leave her father after her mother died.  she has to learn that the promise that she made to her mother to always take care of her family includes taking care of herself as well.  royal loomis enters mattie's life at a very unconventional time when mattie's unsure of what she wants to become and she has to chose between his love and the life she's always wanted.  mattie deals with her teacher, miss wilcox, leaving town.  miss wilcox was mattie's role model who was living the life of an independent poet with a car and a royal lifestyle.  the life mattie wants.    
	this book is intended for a female audience because it deals with issues that sometime only a girl could understand.  it's a fairly easy read so it is more for adolescents than adults but not for young children.  the issues that it deals with are issues that children may not be able to appreciate as much as teenagers who are about to go to college and leave their families.  a northern light is full of valuable lessons, but most of all it's just a good book to get lost in.

1645,"'introducing postmodernism' is a good source to gather names of philosophers, architects, artists, anthropologists, linguists, and everyone in between that have been somehow connected to pm. the problem, and it is a big one, is that this style of tour de force writing does little to contextualize all these diverse disciplines. sure, if you only have half an hour to read up on pm, you can whip through this book and go on with your life. but if you're wanting to really absorb the phenomenon, and perhaps go on to read more, this book is not the place to start. check out david harvey's 'condition of postmodernism.' this will rip the top of your head clean off! it's much more weighty (in every sense of the word), but your understanding of pm will vastly improve, and will better prepare you to go on to other important writers of the 'genre'
"
751,"in this fully illustrated and remarkably brief book, hawking provides an overview of the state of theoretical physics at the dawn of the 21st century. the often dense text is supplemented by biographical details, witty asides, and (especially) luxuriously reproduced introductions.

hawking covers a lot of territory in 200 pages; he hopes to provide brief, non-intimidating summaries of recent concepts and new frontiers in science. there is astonishingly little text, and at times the pithiness, compactness, and occasional ""cuteness"" may work against readers' understanding; there's perhaps too much shell and not enough nut here. some sections are so cursory that i suspect they will fail to make any sense at all to the untutored reader. (this is especially true of several of the passages on imaginary time, event horizons, and brane world models.) 

the text is aided greatly, however, by the beautifully rendered four-color illustrations. even if the concepts presented by these drawings seem fuzzy at first, the creativity and humor fused into moonrunner design's artwork will attract, engage, and occasionally tease readers who might otherwise be frightened by the sight of a quadratic equation. 

overall, then, the book might have far more value as a refresher course for the beginner rather than as an introduction for the uninitiated. yet it's certainly conceivable that somebody new to this material might be intrigued enough to explore these subjects further. if you're looking for a book that will flesh out the concepts presented here, i strongly recommend (as does hawking) alan guth's ""the inflationary universe"" or brian greene's ""the elegant universe.

701,"a pathbreaking work in women's history and the history of deviancy, this book argues (if not entirely convincingly) for a new interpretation of the history and relationship of girl delinquents and women reformers. odem  traces the history of middle class women reformers towards sexual  delinquency by young girls through the particularly rich case history of  los angeles county. noting the diverse cultures in l.a. (white, working  class, hispanic, african-american) odem argues that many girls who became  labeled &quot;wayward&quot; were acting out against oppressive and  repressive families who held old-fashioned and patriarchal views of girls'  sexuality. odem also explores the eventually oppressive route that  reformers took in &quot;retraining&quot; wayward girls
"
273,"i've been very critical of the fiction work of john grisham in recent years and have said many times that he needed to take more time to write his novels to make the stories more interesting.  well, he has taken time off of writing novels to write this interesting, if not spectacular non-fiction work of the trials and tribulations of ronald williamson, a former minor league baseball player implicated in a murder and sentenced to death row.  i won't go into the details of williamson's ordeal, but i will say that grisham has written a pretty cut-and-dried book, that probably would have been handled better by career crime writers, but is still interesting nonetheless.  he does a good job giving the details of ron's case and what he and his family had to go through as events unfolded and ron suffered from growing mental issues.  grisham didn't even think about writing ron's story until after ron passed away, so there are no interviews to draw upon, but he does a decent job of tying it all together.  i will also say that although he is anti-death penalty, he doesn't hammer that opinion at you.  he lets the story itself do the talking.

i'm actually interested in how this book will impact the quality of grisham's next novel, as he'll have actually gone almost 3 years between novels by that time.  hopefully the break will result in a more classic work like ""the firm"" or ""a time to kill"", not dreck like ""the king of torts""
"
1930,"talk about self-absorbed...i guess the ego and the love of self this man displays are essential to success in business...i thought the man made some good points, but few are helpful to anyone in the real world (or outside  the newspaper business).  nausea sets in after the second chapter.   neuharth will die an old, lonely, rich man.  respected by many, hated by  nearly all.  luckily, i didn't have to sit through this entire book.  i put  it down quickly
"
1946,"...if you're in the bathroom with time on your hands! i must admit that i did finish this book and was glad that the ordeal was over.  puzo (like leon uris) definitely lost the touch near the end of his career and this book is no exception.  in just a few hundred pages, president kennedy ii is shown as a tyrant, a socialist, a reactionary, a humanitarian, a political bumbler, a visionary of usa utopia, a man who would kill a few thousand citizens to save himself from impeachment, a liar who can beat the ultimate lie detector, a dear and loving husband/father, etc....how many characters must one man be?  and what's this odd sub-plot of a former-mormon/hollywood oddball who on a whim (in less than 10 seconds of consideration when the opportunity presents itself) decides to kill the president of the united states.  once again another character with fourteen different personalities!.  puzo even got his basic facts wrong about the mormons (he should have stuck with the catholic church). i would hate to be washed up on a deserted island and find this book washed up on the shore next to me! i would go crazy reading it again
"
1680,"i am a big fan of the missing manual series. previous books have given me lots of insights into my installed software and have made my computing time much more efficient. i therefore approached this book with much enthusiasm. office is such a gargantuan program, with tons of bells and whistles, that microsoft itself estimates that most users  take advantage of less than a third of its capabilities.

however, the book is a major disappointment, because of its many mistakes and poor organization. most of the mistakes are ones you can work around--for example, on page 8 the topics covered by appendixes a and b are reversed--but the sheer number of such mistakes makes reading the book a major distraction. every few pages i find myself going to the missing manuals web site to report yet more errata, such as incomplete or wrong instructions, figures that do not agree with the text or figure captions, incomprehensible writing, seeming confusion between the mac and pc versions of the program, etc. and i agree wholeheartedly with a previous reviewer who complained about the inadequate index.

it looks as though o'reilly publishers did not do an adequate proofing of the book, but instead rushed it out as soon as possible. that is too bad, because i will now be much more hesitant to purchase another missing manuals title
"
1875,"it's hard to imagine this book being of much value even for a true and complete novice to prospecting.  written with blatant self  promotion in mind for other garrett products there is little if any substantive information on panning that could not be reduced to 4 or 5 pages with a couple of diagrams added.  would appear author may have been paid by the word given the tedious repetitions found throughout.  truly basic and nothing new here - spend your money elsewhere
"
233,"o'hara is one of the most underrated of american writers. _rage to live_  builds a strong character in grace caldwell tate-- her passions are handled  with delicacy and skill and her story is told with a rare combination of  affection and judgement. a good place to begin with o'hara if you don't  know his work already
"
1287,"this book focuses on a cogent question by way of a true story and invites response from all sorts of people with pertinent experience, providing biographies of these respondents. the topic is forgiveness. i found the analysis by dennis prager, an l.a. talk show host, the most understanding of christian/jewish outlooks and jose hobday's perhaps the best of the christian contributions. i am eager to discuss it with members of my theology group.
"
747,"i give this book a 4 star rating, not because i believe in ""the necronomicon"", but because this particular book has given some very interesting background and historical information on the occult scene in the 1970s. the simon necronomicon itself is an interesting tome (though i doubt it's ""authenticity"" per se). it is at least as valid a grimoire as any other, and more valid than some. ""dead names"" has provided a great deal of information on certain people whose backgrounds are generally not known as well as the unique ""wandering bishop"" phenomena and the so-called slavonic orthodox church. overall, both an informative and entertaining volume, whether you ""believe"" or not
"
856,"this is the first book i have read from this author.  i am truly amazed at how well i enjoyed his style.  it kind of reminded me of some of the good stuart woods books i have read.  i plan on reading many more from michael connelly.  great read, you won't be disappointed, trust me
"
68,"what a great book.  i have been turned off to religion due to the negativeness that surrounds it.  watching joel osteen on tv and reading this book makes me love god even more.  when i think back on my life, i have truly had many blessings and i no longer need to feel guilty for accepting god's blessings.

god has always been about love, hope, faith and greatness.  he has never been about hatred, prejudice or guilt. 
"
1323,"this novel comes off like a high schooler wanting to write about the movie and music industries.  in between the entertainment biz cliches, the author can only think to put various assination hits.  some of the characters are interesting but not believable, and they  certainly can't make up for the braindead plot.  read some of his other novels and skip this one

475,"ms milton admits to her anger at humanistic psychology, so she attacks without understanding.  she does not seem to grasp even some of the basic concepts of the people's work she denigrates.  maslow's hierarchy of needs is one example. i have spent a great deal pf time studding humanistic psychology and writings.  i have had the pleasure of being trained in group therapy with carl rogers, and william coulson as instructors. any one who really studies these writers will see how bad a job ms milton did presenting them.  she should have let her anger subside before she wrote the book.  her bias is extreme and obvious. so consider this when reading the book.  no doubt ms milton will have a new career appearing on the conservative religious programs.  i am sure pat robinson and jerry falwell have or will book her to speak out against the evils of humanistic psychology
"
1439,"an ex-officer in the argentinean military confesses how political prisoners were murdered. i can't write &quot;highly recommended&quot; about this book, because it seems to trivialise those horrible events to some marchendising event. just read it, you may not be able to sleep for few nights, but you'll get a true look into the mirror of evil regimes, supported by the united states only because they were &quot;anti-communist&quot;
"
289,"rarely is there a book that i can not put down, this was an exception. quite a suspensfull page turner. any book that can draw you in and you can visualize the characters and the scenery is excellent and this book did that. i would have given it 5 stars, but i do not like romance blended in with any suspense novel, that's just my taste.  by far,  however, one of the best books i have read in a long time
"
1690,"i really enjoy all of mary engelbreit's books and my little girls do, too. we like to look at them over and over again.  this book is full of ideas from recipes, to summer crafts, to gardening, and to sewing so that you can  make your home an interesting place to visit
"
526,"a surprisingly tiny book. (the picture in the upper-left corner is nearly actual size.) after receiving it, i immediately looked up its dimensions in the description on this page. it says 4.7 x 3.3 x 0.6. i had not noticed that before i ordered it. the book seems much smaller than that. not that that is a problem; it was just somewhat of a shock to find such a minuscule book when i opened the box. 

i believe it is intended to be carried with you in your pocket or glove box or the locket around your neck so you'll have a chance to pick out a few choice topics of conversation before you enter a party or whatever. 

it certainly is not intended as bathroom reading. for one thing, the pages are much too small for emergency tp use. 

not that i am complaining, mind you. this is a gem of a book with over 200 interesting bits of trivia listed more or less alphabetically from ""the amish"" to ""zero"". (this is not to imply that the title of each page has much to do with the text, but who cares - the book is fun.) 

each page has its stated ""fact"" and a follow-up paragraph to expound on the subject.

also, there are a number of pages randomly strewn through the book with three ""instant personalities"" each - little tidbits of info about famous people. (although, thomas jefferson got his own page, as did alfred hitchcock.) 

and unlike another trivia book i purchased recently (bla bla), the information here is actually correct. will and mangesh research their topics, not just publish un-provable ""facts"" gathered from the internet. use the contents with confidence.
"
1273,"james moseley was the stereotypical rich orphan trust-fund kid, inheriting  millions while still in college.  he promptly left college and attached himself to a shady, indiana-jones-style south american graverobber. the graverobber wanted for some reason to do a book on the flying saucer myth, then only a few years old.  moseley was sent crisscrossing the us to interview anyone and everyone who had made contributions to that myth in the period 1947 - 1954.  the book never materialized, but moseley was left with extensive notes, and the indelible and accurate impression that, apart from a few people who had genuinely seen something in the sky they didn't recognize, and would have been expected to if it were anything familiar, the majority of the mythmakers were, as my old grandma used to say, ""crazy as a betsy-bug.""

over the years moseley kept his hand in, meeting and interviewing anyone who came onto the scene in what he sometimes calls the field, other times (more accurately) ""ufoology.""  he edited and published a long series of saucer fanzines and newsletters and still publishes one to this day.  he met everyone and he shrewdly sized up everyone. he organized many flying saucer conventions and seems to have attended most of the others.  here's his information-packed account of about 48 years in the field, and there is no more accurate word-picture anywhere in print in english (i've looked!) of the classic early 1950s contactees led by george adamski, on to the 1960s abductees led by betty hill,  on to the growth of the crashed-saucer myth from its humble beginnings with the 1949 scully hoax, on to the full-blown roswell hoax of 1985 - 90, and on to the ""supernatural"" abduction stories of the 1990s.  moseley was an eyewitness to the birth of many hoaxes, a few of which he perpetrated himself.

highly recommended, as a true insider's look at this nearly 60 year-old and seemingly immortal myth of ""things seen in the sky.

1160,"this book is the same as ""teach yourself origami"" and ""origami, the art of paper-folding"", just with another cover to make you think it is new, also in the webside they describe it as a book of david brill, it does not contain nothing of him, not even his name mention!?!?

1208,"i ordered this book after reading the rave reviews and the who's who of public school using this format.  nowhere is it advertised or even mentioned that this is a christian book, espousing christian dogma and assumptions.  i'm surprised this is acceptable for use by government funded public schools.  furthermore, there is a lot of non-scientific rhetoric in the book that eschews logical debate and exposition.  i'm very disappointed and consider this to be false advertising.  
some of the parenting tips are common sense that i didn't think needed to be reiterated.  a person already interested enough in buying a book would already have the basics down.  i was looking for more than that.  the advertising led me to believe that the book would be about language manipulation, how to speak more effectively with children to ease the learning process.
there is false logic in some of the parental mistakes.  an example is always attributing ""hovering parents"" to ego issues, that a parent ""needs to be needed"".  some hovering parents are survivors of abuse and can't see the lines between normal risks and when a child is in real danger.  false assumptions leads to false conclusions.  
i gave this  2 stars with the thought that someone who is so out of the loop and a danger to their child may read this book-at least could adopt some common sense.  but it isn't helping my family. 
"
1239,"i got to page 26 and gave up.  lockes writings lack focus and are void of humour.  i read as much as i could with patience until it became clear this book was simply someone rambling on about nothing.  save your money for something worth reading

1241,"these mysteries are cozy and interesting and good!!!  they are perfect!!!  i could not ask for a better mystery!!!  not only is the setting and atmosphere cozy, but the clues, story line, and pacing are perfect!  this author definitely has talent!!!  the clues are perfectly and cleverly crafted and lead to the mystery solving.  and the characters - you feel like you know them!!!  i love this small town and all the characters.  not just the main characters, but the other characters have purpose and meaning in this book.

hannah opened up a cookie shop, with the encouragement of her sister, andrea.

hannah finds the milk truck delivery driver dead in his truck. she is determined to find out why he was murdered.

i also loved the cookies and coffee and cold weather!  and i enjoyed the sisters' relationship

1065,"the boston based author, dennis lehane, wrote a great detective story with a social background so great, it is almost more important than the plot. ""mystic river"" differs from lehane's other books and indeed raises him to the next level as a writer.

""mystic river"" is set in the fictional boston suburb, called east buckingham (the author explains it as an amalgamate of dorchester, charlestown and south boston and it really feels like dorchester), home mostly to white working class, with plenty of crime. i liked the background info especially since i could relate to it, knowing the area...

the first part, which is the base and explanation for later events, takes place in 1975, when one of the three eleven-year old neighborhood boys playing in the street is abducted by two men in an apple-smelling car, and although he comes back after four days, his life as well as his friends' is changed forever. the ways of the boys soon part, dave (the boy taken by the men) lives a quiet life, has a wife and a son, and likes his memories of being a football player in high school. jimmy, the ""bad boy"", after doing some time in prison settles down as a storeowner with a nineteen-year old daughter from his first marriage, second wife and their two daughters. the third boy, college-educated sean, becomes a policeman.

when jimmy's beautiful daughter, katie, is found murdered in the park after a night out dave comes home covered in blood, sean gets assigned to the case. there are many leads to different people... but the case is difficult. meanwhile, jimmy and his family embark on the search of their own.

the plot is very good until the end, and psychological details as well as the insights into the society are extremely accurate. the characters are very real, especially jimmy and sean, who are central to the plot. their trauma after dave's abduction made a lasting effect on their lives - in very different ways. they are complicated, multifaceted people, very well developed as literary characters. some side protagonists, depicting perhaps types rather than individuals (bobby, roman, the savage brothers, sergeant whitey), are very good. i was in the grasp of this book until the end - it is not only great entertainment, but also food for thought. 

the movie based on ""mystic river"" with sean penn is equally moving - recommended for those with little time...
"
1384,"many of the columns were interesting . . . painting a picture of a vast right-ring conspiracy that hillary clinton first brought to the public discourse.  but it seems that most of these pieces are obsolete, without any interest either as themselves or as a theme.  does anyone care about texas state politics in 1989, or phil gramm's problems as a senator or as a presidential candidate?  someone should have gone through this and culled out what was obsolete .. except that that would probably have left less material than would make up a book.  just going through a bunch of previously written columns and passing them off as a book may be a cheap and easy way to publish something but it is an inadequate read
"
1700,"i will start this review by noting two things. i greatly appreciated nussbaum's 'upheavals of thought', and i am uncomfortable with the way sex sits in the society i live in. (but, then, i recognise things in myself that - for good or bad - change my perspective from that of the society i am embedded in.) but wedekind's play 'springtime awakening' should raise alarm bells for most of us. 

we are sexual beings (most of us anyway) and we have to deal with that - learn to accept it within ourselves, learn to share it with others (it is, of course, the quintessential sharing experience), learn to grow with it, learn to let it go .... the easy path to take is to grasp a social 'norm' and follow it regardless of the morality of that path. societies do present many 'norms' to a young person developing sexual awareness but not all of these are equally desirable. if nussbaum's book does nothing else but diminish the acceptability of some of the undesirable 'norms', and enhance the more socially responsible ones it will have achieved a great service. 

there are curious things in this book for me. nussbaum refers to many sources but many of them are male - aristotle, seneca, js mill, dh lawrence .... to be fair, the last chapter is about 'to the lighthouse' by virginia woolf, and other writers such as andrea dworkin are prominent. however i was surprised that some powerful women writers are totally ignored - where is mary wolstonecraft, where is emma goldman, where is mary shelley? why is 'maurice' (forster) referred to but not 'the well of loneliness' (hall)? 

the chapter on female genital mutilation (fgm) is an appalling indictment on the behaviour of some societies. nussbaum has a glancing reference to circumcision; not surpringly it is glancing for someone who was converted (so i read) to judaism. while i would never compare what happens to baby boys with what happens to young women in severity or risk, nevertheless i think the motivations for both practices come from the same source. if, for cultural (religious) reasons it is appropriate for jewish boys to be circumcised, i think it is a very dangerous position to take to expect other societies to abandon the practices they see as legitimate, if not mandatory. 

the chapter on equity and mercy impressed me immensely - it is so balanced i expect many feminists will hate it. but for me, her rare use of a christian quote ('forgive them, for they know not what they do.') was a revelation. never before had i seen how compromised that plea is. (compare with tolstoy: 'it is a wonderful thing to be loved because of oneself, but it is a far more wonderful thing to be loved in spite of oneself.') 

the fact that often i have other feelings than nussbaum expresses does not concern me, because she often has perspectives that broaden or hone my own thoughts. in the chapter on prostitution and its illegality i had to agree with most of what she writes simply from a libertarian point of view rather than one of morality. the morality issues are complex - perhaps irresolvably complex. just as there are men with 'dangerous' sexuality, so there are women. perhaps it's only an issue for men because they demand or expect control. for me, all of nussbaum's discussions seem to centre on the effects on women that prostitution entails - this is not inappopriate even though it may not be balanced. the problem i see with prostitution is that it panders to the man's 'need' to have sex. they can get it on demand. this reduces their sensitivities to the needs of the women in their lives, including the need (wise or not) for a woman to have a faithful partner. in australia we had an advisor on women's affairs to the federal government write a piece in a newspaper where she expressed the view - based on her own practice - that a woman should always make sure her husband knew where the red light district was in a city they were visiting, so he could satisfy his 'need' when she herself felt incapable. for me this is an appalling suggestion - as if men cannot have self-control and should not be expected to. but, for all of that, like nussbaum i would not see prostitution as worthy of being made illegal.

for me this was a thought-provoking read. it had some incredibly ugly things to describe, to consider. but it helped me to structure my thoughts in this difficult area - perhaps it will help me guide my boys as they reach maturity. 

other recommendations: 
'springtime awakening' - wedekind 
'the well of loneliness' - radclyffe hall (i hated the outcome of this) 
'matilda' - mary shelley (her biographical details are worth exploring too) 
'godwin on wollstonecraft' - william godwin (mary shelley's father; mary wollstonecraft was her mother) 
'upheavals to thought' - nussbaum 
'living my life' - emma goldman 
'let me alone' - anna kavan 
'conditions of love' - john armstrong
"
53,"a good friend of mine insisted i'd read this book, because she knows i love exploring the spiritual aspects of life. 

in the end i was very disappointed.  not in the writing or the exploration aspects of the book, but michael crichton's whole attitude.  he would spend a chapter sharing his learnings and his eye opening experiences, only to revert back to his arrogant, narrow-minded attitude once again for the next chapter.  how can anyone claim they've learned anything in life when nothing they learn from it seems to sink in?

sadly, this book left me with a very bad taste in my mouth.  i have no desire to read any more of his books
"
1749,"after reading the delightful charlie and the chocolate factory, this sequel was an absolute let-down. the novel begins with the great glass elevator breaking through the ceiling of charlie's (formerly wonka's) chocolate factory and rocketing into orbit around the earth. while beyond the reaches of earth's atmosphere, our heroes---charlie, grandpa joe, and mr. wonka---must deal with the malleable and voracious vermicious knids (pronounced ""k'nids""), aliens which resemble unfrighteningly hostile figs or turds with eyes. far worse than these beasties, though, are the insufferable old folks whose twenty-year stint in their shared bed has made them less than useless. charlie, joe, and wonka, with no help from charlie's folks or other grandparents, save themselves and a us spacecraft from the clutches of the knids and return to the chocolate factory, where the old timers stupidly overdose on youth pills, returning them to infancy or beyond. charlie and wonka race around trying to help these ancient parasites, who respond to this assistance with the thanklessness the reader comes to expect from these oldsters. at the end of the novel, the geriatric brigade finally leaves the bed when they have a chance to meet the president.

in short, these three are the most tedious, spiteful, unredeemable characters i've come across in children's literature and i hoped that they would be eaten by the knids or the gnoolies or even the oompa-loompas as i read this book. as it is, they (unlike the awful kids in the chocolate factory) learn no lessons and persist in their curmudgeonly parasitism from the first page to the last. their presence throughout the novel rendered it a chore, rather than a joy, to read.    
"
1913,"i was very disappointed to discover that this book had a homosexual character. this is absolutely inappropriate for a young adult book, and unless a parent has read the reviews that mention it, said parent would have no clue as it sure isn't mentioned anywhere on the blurb in the book.

i usually am more aware of what my daughter is reading, but this time this particular book slipped under my radar.  she told me that it had a reference to a gay character, which i took to mean just a passing reference, but when i read the book, it was treated more seriously than i thought, even going so far as to have the two girls kiss.

it is inexcusable, both on ms pierce's part and on scholastic's.  no matter what the author's personal beliefs, it is irresponsible to have this type of content without a warning to parents. i believe that as a parent, i'm the one responsible for what my children see and do, but it sure helps to have some type of information so i can make an informed decision.

1292,"i see where this would be appealing to sum. i just never ""got it"".  oh well.
"
960,"i bought this as i'm beginning to study judaism in my spiritual journey.  the book is very well translated and includes recommendations for readings on holidays.  there are also pictures throughout the book from various times and locations.

i'm also very pleased with this since it's in a paragraph format (as someone who's only read the ""hebrew bible"" as part of the old testament i like the ease of reading with the paragraph format).

highly recommende
"
1732,"i first read this book back in the mid-80s after watching the miniseries starring gary cole as dr. jeffrey macdonald.  the miniseries absolutely riveted me, as did this book.  but upon repeated readings, i began to pick up inaccuracies and errors. i found that the book, rather than answering questions about this case, caused me to question more and more. 
joe mcginniss, while never a stellar writer to begin with, was eventually exposed as the worst kind of writer, twisting facts and quotes to serve his own purpose, which was to sell his theory and therefore, his book.  i have nothing against mr. mcginniss forming his own opinion as to dr. macdonald's guilt or innocence, but to omit certain facts and blatantly lie about others and misquote principals and research in order to further your own propaganda is sickening.  
if you want joe mcginniss' theory on how and why the murders happened, with no regard to the cold hard facts and legal evidence, pick this book up.  if you want to read about the case, with all the facts in place both supporting and questioning dr. macdonald, do as other reviewers have suggested and read ""fatal justice"", a far more in-depth review of the case and evidence and form your own opinion. 
"
1633,"this book is total self-propogating hogwash.  garbage. save your money, and your life, avoid this book like a big mac
"
269,"surely i'm not the only one who found this book totally [bad].  the only thing it made me wonder about is how it's possible to write such a thorougly boring book about such fascinating women.  the writing is just dull and full of the author's biases and prejudices, which just aren't nearly as interesting as the subjects themselves.  it's written in that old-school feminism (negative, no fun) tone that thank god feminism has since moved beyond.  my advice:  find another book about women mystics not filtered through flinder's lens
"
1275,"mr. haqqani's views about his mother country are very dubious. the only question i have for the author as he served in some very corrupt governments as their partner...what has he done for his home land? nothing!!! this book in waste of time.
"
620,"this book is perfunctory and extremely shallow. russell's reductive reading of the tradition shows little insight. however, it is amusing at times, hence the star
"
1705,"this is not the book to learn the basics of vbscript, but it's exactly what i needed; a good reference book. i got tired of trying to find syntax of commands and functions online. now i have it at my fingertips
"
997,"i've had this book since 1997 and i still refer to it for ideas.  it has such a unique and diverse pictorial on each page by 'grand' and 'credible' photographers.  for anyone who takes pictures...likes pictures...this book is a must get for you.  i have it on my coffee table and i get rave comments on it all of the time about what a great book it is
"
1253,"this book is the worst book ever. i didn't know there could possibly be a book this bad. if you are required to read this book like me, i feel bad for you. do not read this book for pleasure because it is not a pleasant book. it is painful to read. if you are still thinking of reading this bad book, don't read it!! take my advice.
"
621,"before i bought the pasajes series, i was relieved to see the (then) mostly positive reviews.  however, i really feel like the overall review score of 4.5 stars is very, very misleading.  i would not, in good faith, be able to recommend this series of books for learning spanish.  

this series of books was very confusing and extremely difficult to work with.  some of the many issues with using this series of books to learn spanish:

1) the concepts are not clearly explained (they invented a ""new"" english word for one) and the exercises are excessively complicated and do not give you enough practice with the vocabulary/concepts to feel confident using them.  

2) frequently, new words, phrases and concepts are introduced in the middle of a lesson about something else, via a footnote, with no further explaination provided!!  this is super frustrating and distracting!

3) using this series of books is very cumbersome, the books are not well coordinated with one another, and do not appear to reinforce each other's concepts or vocabulary.

i'm very sorry, but these books are just terrible, and 4.5 stars is not at all reflective of the quality of these books... using this series of books has taken all the fun out of learning spanish, which i used to enjoy.  if you have the option to use different books, take it
"
1928,"qbq! by john miller is simply amazing. this little book is a grand slam all the way! qbq strips away all the excuses and reminds us again where it is the buck is supposed to stop. if you're looking for an instruction manaual for leaders, here it is. people don't need tricks, methods, myths or secrets...what they really need is a tool that helps them step up to the plate and be accountable for their own results. one of the biggest weaknesses of the american workforce is the ability to accept responsibility and accountability for our own actions.   bravo for qbq
"
231,"i read bill bryson's ""a walk in the woods"" and laughed hysterically at many parts of the book, and through the rest was either duly entertained or pleasantly educated (for the ""educated"" aspect, bill interlaces the book with fascinating factual tangents).

i started into ""in a sunburned country"" with similar expectations, and especially since i have always longed and planned to visit australia.  to state that i was disappointed is a severe understatement.  after reading this book i now have little to no desire to visit the ""land down under;"" my only hope is that i will completely forget what i read in bryson's book so that i may one day look forward to and enjoy visiting australia.  (senility be merciful and consume me hastily!)

my best estimate is that bryson was commissioned to write a ~350 page book about australia.  during and / or after his trip, his creative sense must have taken a vacation of its own.  i have rarely struggled so much to get through a book as i did with this one.  bryson even stooped so low as to use an urban legend as a ""story"" relayed second-hand from one of the australians he ""met.""  such a stunt makes me question if any of his accounts are real in any of his books.

the only saving grace to this book was the educational tangents.  these, at least, provided for some interesting reading.

after comparing notes with another person who ventured to read another of bryson's books (""i'm a stranger here myself"") after she read ""a walk in the woods,"" it would appear that ""in a sunburned country"" is not the only snore-fest that bryson has churned out.  perhaps he isn't a ""one hit wonder,"" but i for one am not going to waste my time or money finding out.

so, if you are looking for the same caliber of writing that bryson provided in ""a walk in the woods,"" look to another author or prepare to be greatly disappointed. 
"
451,"always looking for new books on this subject as they are few and far between. this book is written by a cop who knows the business. really like the way its written, funny at times as well as informatove, good read actually enjoyed what can be dry material. highly recommended
"
253,"this story is true to life living in south west and west phila.
it brought back many memories and changing the names did not bother me.  i really enjoyed reading about life the way it was back in the 55 to 70 era.  yes this was life in phila row home.


"
129,"i know all this stuff seems like a good idea but have we forgotten ghb? that was supposedly the fountain of youth a few years ago and now no one hardly even talks about it. let me let you in on a little secret, ghb turned out to be a very addictive substance and in fact a handy little trick to get a girl naked without any problems like dinner movie or even her knowing you for that matter. like hgh, everyone jumped on it before all the data was in. please put your money away and be safe. a pretty face isn't worth the trouble this could potentially cause. and lets be realistic at 60 you really won't ever look 20 again and the weight you would have lost will be the money leaving your pocket book and not the fat from your thighs. work out, do yoga, and eat a healthy vegetarian diet and you can't go wrong. also, when i stopped eating sugar the cellulite also disappeared and so did those extra pounds
"
152,"i have several dummies books, from how to build a pc to ccna.  i had to read this rediculous book when i worked for a very well known dsl provider on the east coast.  this book was trivial, assumes that you are completely mindless and plugs certain products and services shamelessly.  yes, i agree, hot bot is a pretty good search engine...but it is not the only one out there.  this book has technical incosistansies throughout and is basically a really really long advertisement.  easily the worst dummies book in print, and im not being a jerk, i love dummies books, ron gilster rocks, but this is absolute crap.  you can honestly get more informed with a magazine
"
936,"this is a great book to have on your shelf. lots of good recommendations for a beginner quilter
"
1660,"the first novel written by stephenson, and it's a satire on college dorm life.  pointless, rambling, and bizarre.  it's a good thing he's improved his writing over the years, as this one stunk
"
464,"this book does cover alot of information not needed for clep, but it does give you a great guideline on who and what to study for clep and good examples on what questions will look like for the actual clep.  
i wanted to ensure i was prepared for the clep, so i purchased this book and disregarded the other 2 comments.  although, they were right about the obscurity, this book still taught me alot.  
you don't necessarily need it, but if you want to be prepared, this book will not hurt your bank account that much. i also recommend the complete itiots guide to american literature (5 stars, check out the reviews), and the internet.  that is all you need
"
1285,"this book was required reading for a class on children's literature.  so, naturally, i was expecting the very best samplings of what was out there.  the beginning was quite exceptional.  i even invited my husband to read it with me since we share good finds to read together in the evening.  we were about 75% of the way through before its magic halted and it turned to various detailed descriptions of the main character's female body parts.  due to this we feel it falls short as an example of wholesome children's literature.  we set the book down and did not finish it.  if you are looking for good children's literature that completely steers clear of naked images instead of turning to them to keep the pace of the book going, then this book will be a let down.  sad, because up until that point, the writing was quite good.

"
1345,"i was barely able to finish this book. armstrong makes fun of vampires and witches, etc. by dragging in all the cheesy pop culture references she can think of. this made it very hard for me to take her characters seriously. i might have been able to swallow the idea of cabals (giant glitzy corporations run by sorcerors; it's unclear why they don't just take over the world and have done), but armstrong really lost me during the 20-page extended send-up of anne rice's vampires. this genre is rapidly sinking into self-referentialism, and armstrong is the worst culprit. in industrial magic, she ruins what could have been a perfectly good story with these unfunny namechecks and rebuttals to writers who are actually better than she is. on top of that, the viewpoint character, paige, is unfortunately named: she's as flat and boring as the pages she's written on. her central relationship is with her boyfriend, lucas, but their coupleship seems to revolve around the trading of sexual favors. are we supposed to think this is cute and funny? 

take-home project for armstrong: next time, try putting some genuine emotion into your work
"
1326,"this is a good book, but most are under the impression that einstein actually created the content of the book.

einstein actually compiled the physics theories of the latest german and italian physicists and wrote it as his entire theory.

for instance, e=mc^2 was not created by einstein, as so many people people. an italian physicist came up with it. if you don't believe me check any encyclopedia.

einstein suceeded in taking everyone's work and compiling it. this was helpful to the world of physics.

unfortunately, this stuff is outdated, and autodynamics has disproven many things that einstein says in this book. when it came out it was already outdated. this was published in the 60s. autodynamics disproved what is in this book in the 40s (45 i believe). if this was published in the 20s or even the 30s, it would have been a good book
"
705,"grisham's worst book by far.  90% of the story is preaching to the reader that homeless people just have bad luck and are good guys.  it would be ok if that was woven into a good story, but it is not. 

for great grisham read the firm and the partner.  for very good, read runaway jury and pelican brief.  all of these are page turners.

street lawyer is a stomache turner.  really bad.  what happened
"
1098,"i agree with a number of previous reviewers. grimassi stretches a poor understanding of historical context to fit into what he bounces between &quot;wicca&quot; and &quot;witchcraft&quot;.  wicca is not an old religion, indeed it is not much of a religion at all. it has always lacked definite theology (what is the saying about ask three wiccans what they believe and you'll get four answers...) and grimassi does more damage than good by presenting historical materials is non-scholarly lights. in fact, the book is poor on all accounts. from confused terminology to &quot;chopping&quot; of source materials. this is a waste of money
"
1458,"unfortunately, for all the name brand that this book conveys, i think the cover seems to be the most intriguing part.  there are much better ways for book peddling and the fact that a firm such as mckinsey allowed their name on the title of a book for the sake of a few sales, boggles this readers mind.  the subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull session with all bull and no session.  no actual quantitative analysis is used throughout the book, and if anything more than an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book, i would be astounded.  save some money and go search online for some basic books on beginning valuation.  by the way, those giving 5 stars either can't read english very well or are shills for mckinsey
"
865,"good, but it simply wasn't actionous enough. i don't mind having no action in a book (otherwise how else could i love foundation so much?), but children was a book that needed to have action in it. unfortunately it didn't really. too much philosophical babble that i had to re-read to get it. slightly reminiscent of card's later shadow series with the sheer amount of internal monologue. too much about jane, not enough about the pequeninos and barely anything about ender, which annoyed me. to my shock ender's death did not really impact me in any way, beyond--""huh? wait...ender is dead?"", so little was his role in the book. he probably talked for only about twelve pages altogether.

edit: from now on i am never giving a book that i halfway like two stars again because each time, i receive the urge to change my rating to three stars.  just keep in mind that while it says two, it means three
"
309,"dr. hawkins first book, power vs force was interesting and presented a useful way to dowse using kinesiology.  however, he began to venture into misapplication of this method, and has now gone off on a tangent where he seems to wish to delude himself into thinking he has developed a fool-proof way to judge the level of consciousness of any entity, concept, or construct and the truth or falsehood of any statement.  there are serious logical, philosophical, and practical flaws in his work, and his attempt to quantify matters that aren't quantifiable leads to meaningless data that probably matches the bias & beliefs of those carrying out the muscle tests.  this book is a good example to present to show how people can deceive themselves and misuse muscle testing and dowsing techniques.  the actual technique is worthwhile, but much of what hawkins presents in the book is utterly meaningless and invalid.  the levels of awareness that can be tapped into with dowsing are wise enough to not let us ask just anything we wish to and be able to receive accurate, valid answers.  
hawkins explores issues about media, politics, religion, spirituality, history, philosophies, healing arts, entertainment, and more, and reveals his own gross ignorance on many matters.
he seems unaware that many of the people he trusts in politics and media are professional gangsters, liars, and two-faced sociopaths.  he has a negative view of conspiracy theorists, many of whom are genuinely determined to find the truth and don't resort to hawkins' misguided shortcut attempt to identify truth.  hawkins also fosters confusion with his description of his muscle test method, as it really has little to do with applied kinesiology, but is a form of dowsing where the muscle is directed to remain weak or strong in lieu of muscle response moving a pendulum or rod.  i hope hawkins gets to reconsider his current efforts...consciousness and spiritual research are vital endeavors and there are others doing useful, responsible work in those areas.  for now i'd encourage hawkins to recognize that 911 was in part an inside job, many conservative politicians and pundits are corrupt frauds, and the overall maturity of consciousness in america is not greater than the rest of the world
"
1030,"i read les miserables after i saw the opera, and it has inspired in me more than any book i've ever read.  i don't believe one could ever find a better novel anywhere.  for everyone out there--read this now!!  there is a character that will touch everyone, no matter what type of person you are.  this novel is easy to relate to, and exciting.  it also give some insight to the unwritten history of the revolutions in france during napolean's time.  i recommend strongly to everyone to read this book, and see the opera.  it really will effect your life
"
1103,"for the first quarter of the book, i thought eugenia was (to be polite) a witch. she slowly became likeable. all of poor cyrus's choices in clothing were so tacky. the story had a good blend of romance and mystery. after reading this book and all the talk of glass, i have a serious interest in collecting glass art
"
1007,"first off, i loved the book cover- spine and all-- one of my all time favorites. it's what first attracted me to this book amongst the other forward-facing covers on the store's front table. then the title, i loved that just as much. both share the characteristics of being straightforward, to the point, and revealing. both are perfectly simple. i read most the essays and came to think that a. this guy really does his homework and b. he has a vocabulary more voluminous than the decimal numbers of pi. i constantly begged for my dictionary. it's probably what gets him the press i knew before i picked this up: an intellectual snob. i guess he got that from the oprah incident. but i also guess that there's lots of worse name calling that can happen to anyone in their career. what's up with this culture that it's so unacceptably horrible to be labeled an intellectual snob and so enviously warming to be called a pop culture icon? the attraction to franzen's work is that he investigates and reveals- in a binary way: he's researching facts, he's listening to feelings; he's processing both to give an opinion. the best example of this is my father's brain in which he relates the alzheimer induced decomposing of his father's brain. there is lots about the history and science of memory in this essay; as much as there is about how a family discovers and lives with its loss. reading it you sympathize, you empathize and you learn. equally as insightful are :

the reader in exile- a great reflection on the intellectual and emotional fruits of reading
first city- a historical and pensive piece about what pulls us towards cities
meet me in st. louis- a piece that shares the two-sided feelings in a trio of situations (including the oprah incident).

926,"i seem to be in the minority, but i did not enjoy this book at all. the main character is, of course, the ""only female to ever survive becoming a werewolf"" but this was only the start of her amazing speshulness. i felt the plot got swallowed up by the author's need to self-insert and 'play' in her world, and the only reason i finished this book was that i was on a plane and had nothing else to do. the plot fishtails several times, and isn't all that interesting to start with. in short, i was left with a bad taste in my mouth concerning the author in general, and will likely skip her books in the future
"
1785,"when one begins to despair about the quality (or lack thereof) of the modern novel you come across a gem which dispels that despair for the time being. not only is this one a gem but also it is something much more and being just over 240 pages one that i finished all too quickly. i could not get enough of it. the narrator and main character of the novel is a mr. stevens who is the butler of a mansion where he heads a considerable compliment of staff to keep it running smoothly. his employer, a lord darlington, is doing what he can to alleviate some of the supposed harsher terms of the versailles treaty and realizes too late that he was being used as a pawn by the germans. and what did mr. stevens think of this? he didn't, he maintains that wondering about what was happening would have interfered with his running of the estate. there is also the head housekeeper that he buts heads with a few times and also a few other instances which makes one wonder if she has something other that a professional interest in mr. stevens. you'll have to read the book if you want to know more. i read mainly victorian literature simply because they are well written and what passes for a novel nowadays usually is not. if you get this book you will not be sorry.
"
1567,"i was so disappointed in this book. i don't find a closeness to god in the pages. instead it seems intellectual. it contains beautiful sounding prayers that are more like poetry than speaking with god face to face. even though it contains prayers from across the ages it seems to keep me distant from the personal god i seek. and though the author's prayers are included too, i feel the same about them. i expected more from richard j. foster
"
567,"for years, i had heard the akashic records being touted as the unwritten spiritual book of life, that included every event, every living soul who had ever taken a breath from the beginning of time through eternity. the subject was beyond fascinating, as my limited mortal mind could not grasp the enormity of such a body of knowledge ""existing"".
however, i took it on absolute faith that this was so and recently endeavored to find the quintessential book on the subject. knowing of mr. cayce's tremendous psychic following, i assumed this book would enlighten me and others. i excitedly bought a new copy for myself and sent another to a friend.
after trudging through the first 68 pages, i felt lost and befuddled. the writing and text are difficult to follow and not at all in ""layperson's"" language.
perhaps this book is meant for an experienced psychic mind and intellect, one who understands the language and is willing to muddle through the long-winded case histories to discover meaning and relevance.
my friend confessed she had read a mere chapter or two, then set it aside.

1162,"bailie draws on rene girard's theory of foundational violence as the generative cultural force, and explores its modern effects on a culture no longer enthralled by ritual or sacralized violence.  i found especially compelling the newspaper accounts of violent acts which have taken place within my own memory.  bailie uses these along with historical accounts of scapegoating to illustrate his theory, producing a hard-hitting indictment of all forms of violence, whether isolated actions or legalized responses to a violent act.  increasingly, i find it difficult to distinguish between an act of violence and an act of retributive justice.  i have not read a newspaper account of a violent encounter the same way since reading violence unveiled, nor do i react to photojournalism with my previous detachment.  the impact stays with me, despite the fact that i read the work initially two years ago when i borrowed it from a friend.  i now have my own copy, heavily underlined and notated in the margins with thoughts spawned by bailie's excellent analyses.  provocative and insightful
"
105,"honestly, i thought the book was just plain boring and repetitive.  the author's main point, although interesting, seems to me like it would fit into an essay.  also, the particular print of the book that i purchased, has a dog on the cover, i was very much expecting the book to center around dog behavior.  instead, i felt i little duped. most insight into dog behavior came from previous third person experiments/theories or anedoctal accounts of ""my friend's dog fido, one day did this...""  i hardly think that what one dog did can be generalized to the whole dog population.  i mean, the author doesn't even have a dog!!  i suspect that i, who have had a lifelong history with dogs, have more first hand experience with dog behavior than the author. 

i don't recommend this book to all the dog lovers out there.  now, if your ""thing"" is cows....  get this book!

407,"reviewed by joanne benham for reader views (2/06) 
 
it's an ordinary sunday afternoon for odelia grey.  an afternoon spent with her dysfunctional family means a stop at the grocery store on the way home to buy her favorite comfort food, stouffer's macaroni and cheese, to get the taste of her family (and her rotten date on saturday night) out of her mouth.  and then she gets the phone call.....her dear friend sophie, a staunch supporter, mentor and banner carrier for bbw----big, beautiful women---has committed suicide.  as she struggles to cope with this heartbreaking news, she has more disturbing news piled on.  not only did sophie commit suicide, she did it in front of dozens of eyewitnesses on her adult website!!!  with the emergence of more hidden facets of sophie's life, odelia finds it difficult to reconcile this new sophie to the sophie she knew and loved.  
 
as odelia digs deeper into sophie's life, both past and present, she comes to the conclusion that sophie would not, under any circumstances, kill herself.  with backup help from a memorable cast of characters, odelia sets out to clear her friend's name and in the process gains a new acceptance of herself as a fat woman in a thin society.
 
this book was enjoyable on so many levels.  first and foremost, it is very well written.  second, it confronts the prejudice that is openly shown to fat people in today's society and gives a gentle nudge toward developing tolerance.  and finally, it leaves you impatiently awaiting the next installment in the life of odelia patience grey......the best new heroine to spring from the pages of a book in years.

"
1356,"""dark tort"" was inoffensive and certainly not painful to read, but for a novel that's supposed to be part of a quirky, light mystery series, i found things a bit leaden.  the book took forever to get past the opening scene where the body was discovered, and when we finally do move beyond that scene, a huge tangle of clues and suspects quickly built up that slowed things down even further.  

i do admit that it also doesn't help that i'm one of those people who can't suspend disbelief and have to ask, ""...so she's an off-site caterer yet she continually runs across dead bodies whose murderers need to be identified?""  but, that's just me.  oh, well... many of the recipes did sound good, though i doubt i'll get around to making any of them.

this is one of those reviews where it's probably best to just say that if you liked the previous entries in this series (which i personally haven't read but suspect aren't much different than this one), you'll likely enjoy this installment, too.  the rest of us can just wait for the latest robert b. parker ""spenser"" novel for our light mystery fix.

74,"i tried reading it, and made it about 3-4 pages.  i'm pretty sure that's a bad sign.  i seem to recall mr. sedaris writing about his mother's bedpan or something.  the impression i instantly got was ""beep beep!  pretentious young writer peddling so-called bad childhood experiences for fame, money and sympathy.""  guess what, mr. sedaris?  i don't give a (expletive deleted) about your so-called bad childhood.  millions of people have bad childhoods and don't play the sympathy card.  check out augusten burrough's books, they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style. 
"
88,"i have just finished reading &quot;the power of ethical management,&quot; and i thought it was well written.  in the past few weeks i have read several other books on business ethics and this one is my favorite.  it is  short and exact with great details on how to improve your corporation as  well as yourself.  this book not only can be applied to the work place but  in your life at home, family, friends, and children.  this book has helped  me greatly
"
300,"this book was someone else's bookclub selection, and i think having no expectations when i picked it up really helped in my having that wow experience that some folks report with this book and others miss. yes, the prose needed much better editing: overuse of repetition, ""stock"" phrases, and ""hanging"" assertions that should have been cleaned up.  however, i found the discussions of brain development/evolution, similarities between certain animal behaviors and human behaviors, development of language in different animals, and the coevolution of humans and dogs to be facinating (oops, just gave away the ending!).  i found the side discussion of outcome-based audits interesting and enlightening.  i also liked dr. temple's recommendation that people with autism be hired for baggage checking positions.  great idea! although the book really goes all over the place, i found it a wonderful opportunity to engage my ""seeking/hunting"" motivation (you'll have to read the book for that one), and worth wading through the flaws to pick up the nuggets of gold
"
1330,"i must say i enjoyed the book, but the ending was so sudden, with so many things left hanging, that i was disappointed.  i wish one more chapter had been written to clear up- how did manderly catch fire, what did they do when they got to the burning house, and how did they pick up their lives. all we had at the ending was ashes. also, the narrator, who never gives her name, was sometimes very odd- hiding behind doors in her own home, sneaking food, hiding behind chairs. the book is worth reading, but i wish that, instead of spending so much time describing the trees and the sea, du maurier had written a better ending.
"
715,"i was wrong. ok, i've admitted it. i always thought science fiction or futuristic type novels weren't my cup of tea. while reading conspiracy in death i realized i couldn't have been more wrong - i love this futuristic series! 

a homeless man is murdered and the case is assigned to eve dallas, since it's not a random act of violence. this man, snooks, died when his heart was surgically removed by what appeared to be a very skilled surgeon. when dallas digs a bit further, she discovers that this crime is connected to another committed in new york city where an aged lc (licensed companion) died as the result of her liver being removed. after even more digging, dallas discovers a case in chicago and one abroad that were all similar. 

these were not the result of black market organ sales since all of the victims were within a few months of dying. in order for eve dallas to find the murderer she had to figure out why these victims were chosen. the closer she got to that answer, the more nervous very influential politicians and doctors became. 

when she got too close to the truth, the villain had to put a stop to her investigation. the best way to get dallas off the case was to have her suspended from the police department. this was a simple procedure since there was a conflict between the patrol officer who discovered snook's body and dallas. when that patrolwoman was brutally murdered suspicion fell on dallas. stripped of her badge and weapon, the very items that have been the heart and sole of her during her adult life, she has to deal with not only the idea of not being a police detective, but also with trying to solve this crime having her hands tied. 

the main plot was interesting but the villain was predictable and no surprise. there was excellent character development and as usual j.d. robb (aka nora roberts) draws the reader into the suspense to the point of not being able to put down the book. what makes this book above average and falling into the excellent range is the fantastic subplot of eve dallas being stripped of her identity as a policewoman and how she must deal with the various facets of that. at times, it was more intense and more exciting that the main plot. 

this is definitely one to read, as all of the ""in death"" series books have been. start with the first book when reading because j.d. robb always has a couple of instances where she reflects on previous happenings. or you can start with the first book just because it's the beginning of an excellent adventure!
"
1206,"isn't it frustrating when a book spends a lot of time building up the problem-to which you say, &quot;yeah! yeah! that's me!&quot; and then gives you no answer, or a weak one to which you say, &quot;no duh!&quot; i'm afraid this book is one of them. the title is misleading because you assume he will help you find the life you've only dreamed of, or at least point you in the right direction to get started! but i was left depressed after reading it because it basically says that god gives us desires that we can't have on earth so that we will long for him and heaven. i don't believe that's the abundant life jesus promised. so i went to the bible. (i should have gone there first!) i looked up every time it talks about desires and got my answer. &quot;delight yourself in the lord and he will give you the desires of your heart!&quot; ps. 37:4 so i set out to seek him. i started reading &quot;knowing god&quot; by j.i. packer and began to get answers to all my questions about desire! i hope you'll find them too-in him

557,"i've been working with foals for about 18 years.  this book is well written and includes very good illustrations.  it's good for new handlers and experienced handlers (reminders of different options to use with different personalities) as well.  i highly recommend it
"
653,"i picked this book up a couple days ago with a few others, hoping to learn about america's prison system.  i think our prison system is horrible and i was hoping that this book would give me some more information on the topic.  unfortunately, in the first twenty pages of the book, elsner claims that america imprisons 704 people per every 10,000 citizens.  if you do the math, that equals 7% of our population. 7% of our population is greater than the population of the state of new york.  according to this author, there are more people in prison in this country than live in the state of new york. 

before you get too worried, let me reassure you that this is not the case.  america imprisons 736 people per *100,000* citizens (as of 5/06), or .736% of the population.  this is the highest rate in the entire world, so there's no need to move the decimal point to make it seem more dramatic. for comparison, stalin had .771% of his citizens imprisoned in the gulags during the height of the purges.  again, there's really no need to exaggerate america's rate of incarceration. what disappoints me is that this error is not simply a typo on one page, but is repeated several times.  apparently the author actually believes we imprison 7% of our population, and the editors at prentice hall think that makes sense as well, as do all the luminaries who glowingly endorsed this book on the back cover. 

personally, i can't take anything this author says seriously if there are errors so blatant a novice in the subject can them pick out, on the first twenty pages no less.  if a subject as basic as prison population is exaggerated by a power of 10, how do we know the rest of the book isn't off by a power of 10? elsner makes prison reform advocates look like the bunch of uninformed dreamers conservatives like to imagine.  don't buy this book
"
172,"thirty five years ago my high school (thomas jefferson, in federal way, washington) held annual competitions in mathematics.  they did it in the form of a test that came bound in a small white booklet, just was a few pages long.  there weren't many questions, perhaps a dozen or two (usually in the form of story problems), but they required deep thought and concentration (at least for me).  i still remember the feeling of excitement and trepidation as i took the ""white book"" and opened it to the first problem.  several hours later i'd consider myself accomplished if i'd managed to completely answer more than half the questions.  

ian stewart's book reminds me of those tests.  here's a sampling of what's inside:

1)mrs. anne-lida worm decides she wants a new couch, and tells mr. worm to get it for her, while she goes shopping for a new tight for baby wermintrude.  but anne-lina doesn't want just any couch.  she wants the biggest possible couch that can be carried down the hall in their house, and around the 90-degree hall at the end.  what shape does the couch have, and how big is it?  this is a truly riveting story.  will mr. worm solve the couch problem in time?  

2)alberto wants to conduct tests on grapes, evaluating the influence of different soils.  he wants to conduct experiments to see how different soils and exposure to the sun affects the quality of wine.  his land is on a hillside, though, which is narrow, so he can plant only three varieties of grape on each plot of land.  how can he arrange things so that he tests all seven varieties of grapes when they are arranged so that each plot contains exactly three different species, where any two plots have exactly one variety in common, and any two varieties lie in exactly one common plot?

sixteen chapters make up this book.  though their titles are whimsical, the mathematical problems aren't.  some are still unsolved.  even though these problems fit in what would probably be called recreational mathematics, they are fiendishly cleaver with solutions, and developed insight along the way, that are at once challenging and rewarding.  here's a sample of some of other topics discussed in stewart's book:

how might one transport a lion, llama, and head of lettuce in a boat, across a lake, without leaving any two species where one might eat the other in the absence of a caretaker?  how can you calculate the temperature and entropy of a curve?  how can one even talk sensibly about a curve having temperature and entropy in the first place?  suppose that you need to tile a room, and the tiles come in odd shapes.  is there anyway to know if the tiling problem has a solution?  can mathematics tell us things about evolution, such as whether or not evolution comes gradually or in spurts (or both)?  

this is a fun, lighthearted book, but the mathematical problems and puzzles it discusses will really make you think.  i enjoy reading as i exercise on my elliptical machine.  i get double the sense of accomplishment when i can read and workout at the same time.  ordinarily, i can estimate how long i've been on the machine by how many pages i've read - 20 pages in 40 minutes is about average.  but with stewart's book i had to be careful.  several times i found that i'd worked out for an hour and only managed to cover half-a-dozen pages or so.  

if you love mathematics, particularly mathematical puzzles, then this is a book you'll really enjoy.  it has many problems for the reader, with answers at the back of each chapter.  if you do the problems and understand everything in the book, in detail, it will occupy many hours of your time.  all in deep thought and utter enjoyment.

"
213,"written in cartoon format, i thought this book would be a lighter approach to a straight, dry, biography of scientists.  however, it is written more like a series of political cartoons than cartoons for kids.  the cartoons are barely understandable if the biography of the scientist is not already known, so using it as an initial reading is impossible.  further, some content is offensive.  on the second page of cartoons, a scientist is walking along a bridge, thinking, when someone mistakenly believes he is getting ready to jump, saying, ""no woman is worth committing suicide over.""  the pictures show a scantily-clad woman (with bare bottom in one frame) that he is now picturing in his mind.  irrelevant and inappropriate!  plus, i didn't have to go far to find swear words in the captions.  yikes!  my kids will never see this book!  it is not even appropriate for high-school age kids.  (in fact, it isn't even funny to adults!
"
888,"the book gives you the tech you need, in terms you can understand.  calder is very impressive in his ability to impart knowledge to the layman.  don't however, assume this is just fluff overview, because it truly is the down and dirty of how it works and how to maintain it. 
"
481,"i enjoyed this book immensely.  

remember, the subtitle is ""my friendship with jfk, jr."", the book is about the author and his friendship with john.  it's not meant to be a historical view of jfk and his presidency.

why is it ok for carole radiwill to write a book about her relationship with jfk, jr. and carolyn but not ok for billy noonan? because he wasn't on oprah.

lighten up. 
"
1824,"first published in 1936, this is the 12th poirot book, the 3rd superintendent battle book, and the 2nd colonel race book, and has no narrator. it's the first case in which superintendent battle, mrs. oliver, or col. race appear together with poirot or each other, and the only case in which *all* do so at once.

the story opens at an exhibition of snuffboxes, where poirot encounters mr. shaitana, a collector with a catty manner and a knack for gossip. shaitana deliberately cultivates a mephistopholean pose, which at first makes him seem like the potential quarry in the case - but it becomes clear that he's a victim waiting to happen.

for shaitana, like a few other collectors in christie's universe, has succumbed to a foolish temptation, and begun collecting *people* - and not just people of talent or genius, but murderers. and being a connoisseur, he collects only the best: those who have gotten away with it. he amuses himself on this occasion by boasting to poirot of his hobby, without naming names, and inviting him to a little supper party to meet his collection of ""tigers"" (poirot having just pointed out that he himself could admire a tiger, but would do so from outside the tiger's cage, having respect for the danger.)

poirot accepts the supper invitation, however, to find that there are seven other guests, including the three other detectives as well as four guests who are presumably the murderers: explorer major despard, a strong silent type; mrs. lorrimer, a middle-aged widow who is *very* serious about bridge; timid young anne meredith; and dr. roberts, a loud and jovial general practitioner.

shaitana drops hints referring to four possible methods of murder, but otherwise the subject does not come up, and the guests proceed to play bridge after supper - arising from the final game to find their host dead, stabbed sitting beside the fire in full view of the players!

this is, of course, poirot's fantasy case, as he once remarked in the abc murders - because there is no tangible evidence against any one person more than another. there are only the people themselves, and their memories of the evening, and the bridge scores reflecting how the evening progressed. solving the case depends entirely on being able to understand the people involved. but how to get them to reveal their true selves to an interrogator - or to uncover the crimes that shaitana believed they'd committed and gotten away with?

rather than following poirot's viewpoint in third person throughout, some chapters follow battle, race, or mrs. oliver as they conduct their own enquiries into the case. each represents a different style: battle is a professional police officer, race an empire-builder-type secret agent, and mrs. oliver a writer of detective stories. battle, of course, has a duty to investigate shaitana's murder, and does so in an orthodox style, cultivating an image of plodding hard work that tempts one to underestimate him. race deals with checking out major despard, the explorer who's most clearly his kind of person. mrs. oliver, for her part, works on worming information out of not only anne meredith, but her roommate rhonda (whose attitude is that anne could've lived like a duchess for the rest of her life on blackmail if she'd been paying attention).

and, of course, there's poirot. he's really fascinating to watch in this one as he interacts with each suspect in turn, pursuing two major lines of questioning:
(1) describe how the bridge games played out, and
(2) describe the scene of the murder (the elaborate collector's room in shaitana's house where the bridge games were played).

see if you can figure out where poirot's questions lead before he reveals his reasoning to his colleagues, and what he learned from the responses he received
"
1554,"those who condemn this book for not being a long, boring list of name origins and meanings, or for stating that their name has gone out of style for today's children, are missing the point. ""baby names now"" is a fun, readable guide to what people are naming their children in the early 2000s, including famous namesakes (saints, popes, presidents, royalty, music and movie stars) and what some celebrities have named their children. it's also fascinating to read how certain names have gone out of style: for example ""lisa,"" ""amy,"" ""susan"" and ""dawn"" were very popular for babies born in the 60s (and thus, my classmates), but are rarely used today. 

the book's major flaw is in not recognizing that parents name their children using the last names of people they admire, not just the first names. at one point, it reads ""harrison ford...is almost certainly the reason for the name harrison's popularity"" - excuse me, ever hear of the beatles? the entries for the name ""jordan"" don't mention michael jordan, certainly a major inspiration for that name in this area. the entry for ""jackson"" doesn't mention michael, janet, or samuel l.  the entry for ""landon"" doesn't mention michael. the entries for ""cassidy"" don't mention david and shaun, so popular in the 70s when many of today's moms were growing up. the entry for ""lucas"" - do i have to say it, fellow star wars kids grown up and naming their children? and come on, how can you mention the name ""wayne"" without acknowledging the popularity of john wayne?

still, this is a lot of fun, and i give the authors credit for recognizing that ""althea"" is from a grateful dead song. i look forward to the next edition
"
1795,"as far as style goes, i found this pretty boring from what i saw in the bookstore. glad i never bought it, races of eberron is much better, as it has three great races (fourth isn't so hot) including one living construct type.

in fact, from races of eberron i made one changeling druid who has near complete cold adaptation and heat adaptation (from environment series), and a warforged monk which was effective against lycanthropes.

what can races of the dragon possibly give you? flying creatures? firebreathing creatures? you could be better off with weaked-down angel or better yet just a birdfolk race (like raptorans in races of the wild, which by the way also has more variety with its catfolk).  as for firebreathing, a feat could probably give you the whole fire-eating/fire-blowing act and save you the whole freakish thing of having weird blood. 
"
1367,"the book appears to give comprehensive coverage in terms of the number and type of entries included.  however, on the atkins diet, the important measure to monitor is the &quot;active&quot; carbohydrate mass which may  metabolised and which excludes roughage or fiber.  the inclusion of such a  measure in the book would greatly enhance its value and utility
"
1734,"this book started well, but fell flat in the middle. what little conflict there was in the beginning was resolved halfway through. even the shooting incident couldn't manage to hold my interest because it was resolved so quickly.

well, i didn't bother to finish it--i have limited time for reading, and i don't like to waste it.

"
468,"this is a charming little book.  it's very concise, profusely illustrated, and it covers the basic geometry of platonic and archimedean solids.  it delightfully summarizes the work of plato/theaetetus, archimedes, euclid, kepler, and euler in only 57 pages, half of which contain only illustrations.  as a model-builder who attaches no special religious significance to polyhedra, i was a little concerned when i looked at the other books in the series that this book might be about ""sacred geometry.""  fortunately (at least from my point of view) it does not contain a word about it, except for a cursory reference to the elements plato associated with each of the platonic solids.  a table at the end includes the dihedral and central angles and edge/radius ratios for all the platonic and archimedean solids--all the info a model builder needs!  this book won't impress anyone with a mathematics background, but for a layman like me, it's a perfect introduction.  kudos to sutton for putting this material in such an elegant and accessible format

635,"i didn't discover the delight that is the artemis fowl series until a week ago, when i read artemis fowl in one day.  so, of course, i had to pick up a copy of the arctic incident right away, to see if it was as good as the first.  it definitely is, and in my own humble opinion, i think i liked it even better than the first book.  there are points throughout the book where artemis, now thirteen, shows a softer, more vulnerable side that i truly enjoyed.  don't get me wrong, he's still an evil genius, but he's an evil genius with heart, and you can't help but love him.

now that angeline fowl is out of her depression, thanks to some fairy magic from captain holly short, she's sent artemis back to saint bartelby's school for young gentlemen in ireland.  artemis is having quite a large amount of fun flumoxing the school's counselor, dr. po, when he gets an urgent message from butler, his bodyguard/butler/majordomo--it seems that artemis fowl the first is alive in russia, being held for ransom by the russian mafiya.

young artemis, of course, immediately sets out to devise a scheme to rescue his father.  it's been almost two years since artemis senior was last heard from, and his son is most eager to bring him home.  before he can work out a devious scheme, though, he's visited by none other than captain short and her superior, commander root, and brought down to haven city and into police plaza.  it seems the goblin triad, the b'wa kell, have a human counterpart aiding in their smuggling, and artemis the second is, quite justly i believe, suspected of being that human.

the fairies soon realize, however, that this time artemis fowl isn't the bad guy in this problem.  but now they'd like artemis and butler's help in figuring out who is behind the allaince between the goblins and the mud men--and artemis is quite willing to help them out, in exchange for the fairies help in rescuing his father.

what follows is an action-packed story of good versus evil below ground, with deceptions, backstabbing, and revenge taking center stage.  as holly, root, butler, and artemis race to save haven city from being destroyed, some of the same characters from the first book make appearances--foaly, mulch diggums, cudgeon, and captain trouble.  there's also a new foe in the arctic incident, opal koboi, to be dealt with.  

i highly recommend the artemis fowl series to anyone and everyone.  highly enjoyable, thoroughly entertaining, and not soon forgotten.
"
134,"i found the first book, faerie wars, pretty interesting so i decided to read this one. in many ways it had excellent qualities such as suspense, mystery and a bit of romance. i'll have to admit, i finished the book pretty quickly because i got hooked onto it and didn't want to put it down. there were many twists and turns of the plot, and it was practically impossible to guess what would happen next at times.
i did, however, find the ending a tad abrupt. it was such a shame to finish the book without any more information on pyrgus, mr. fogarty, henry or blue. but overall the book was an excellent one..... it will certainly capture your interest
"
399,"i picked this up because it's considered a classic and i knew it had been made into a movie.  i tend to think that if a book is made into a movie, then the book must be pretty good.  not so with howard's end.  the plot in howard's end doesn't progress much outside of an early death and later marraige.  you have to have some interest in the characters, but they just weren't very believeable.  none of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world.  i kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting, but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance.  the story is clearly dated and doesn't hold up well so many years later.  living in today's world, it's hard to understand what attracted margaret to henry.  there definately is an audience for this book.  i'm just not a part of it
"
517,"i bought this classic novel on cd thinking it would hold the interest of my 2 grade school boys, who enjoy books on cd while driving to and from school.  they did not like the narrator's snobby french accent nor could they understand many of the words.  this is a great cd for high school or adults but not children.  a bust for us.

1043,"if a book makes me look forward to mid-life - i am all over it! this book was actually required reading for my course study in human development - what a find!  here, harvard researcher and bestselling author, joan borysenko, takes the cycles of a woman's life and divides them into 7 year increments. along the journey, she also makes a great case for debunking old myths about women and aging.?that's a big 10-4, ms. borysenko! i find myself constantly at odds with the ""beauty"" images that the media gives us.  i mean, come on, why 'o why are we more often rewarding people for how they look and less for what they contribute to society?  

perhaps it's escapism - i tell myself (in effort to sleep at night).  yet, after reading borsyenko's, book i'm reminded that, yes, it's good to follow intellectual pursuits. and, yes, there's differences between women and men.  according to borysenko, women are most often motivated by what they can contribute to society, family, and how to make a difference in the world.  men tend to define themselves by their work.  most telling!  anyhow, i won't give away the store here - but in my opinion, if you are of the female persuasion, you will not want to miss this read.

1024,"i just got through reading ""harvey penick's little red book"".  i enjoyed it so much that i had to apologize about my delay in submitting a positive comment on the seller's feedback page. but the book was that enjoyable! i read the book because i was told it is a good example in marketing and business management ideals.  i don't even play golf! i was able to apply harvey penick's words to attitudes and approaches to life though!  he not only teaches what he has learned about golf during his long rich life, but he also teaches a philosophy in how to live one's life.  his methods of evaluating the actions of his students and sharing what he has learned in an effort to improve thier lives is obvious to me.  he refuses to use negative impressions in his teachings.  instead, he accentuates the positive.  he educates by guiding his students instead of ""teaching"" them.  i love his ability to teach with images, parables and metaphors.  his chapter ""first things first"" about the golfer who wanted to get out of sand traps is great!  after all, the problem is not always what you think.  i challenge anyone to read ""harvey penick's little red book"" and share with me how they can apply his knowledge to thier business and personal lives.  whether you play golf or not, this book is good reading
"
1750,"i really enjoyed this book. i found it in a bookstore one day and read it for pleasure slowly. i am a theory student (now) so i wanted to see a lot more math, but aside from that shortcoming (which some might welcome) it was just a fantastic description of fluid motion and derivations of the governing equations on a simple level.

1844,"my daughter at u of m got me interested in the rwandan crisis and was just vacationing in canada and picked up this book by a canadian general who was leading the un effort in rwanda during the genocide and what a tragedy this  was and remains. i didnt walk away thinking this guy was a great general but he had the guts and the commitment to right to stay in spite of the ineptitude of the united nations and cofi anan who was in a key role at the time. the tragedy of what the free world stood by and let happen is nearly unsurpassed, probably only by the jews extermination in wwii. if you have any interest in the world happenings and think you have faith in the united nations just buy this and read it - we need change.

734,"i'm sorry i wasted the money. i can see by the reviews you either love it or hate it.  i'm not squeamish by nature, but this book is one continuous torture fest which not only targets human victims, but animals as well.  three quarter's way through, when i realized this indeed was the premise from beginning to end, i started skipping these parts (which got me to the last page quite quickly). i was bored and disgusted with the author.  i believe he had a sick fetish and lived them out through these pages. in the end my eyeballs got six-pack abs from rollng around so much.  this book is going on my ""do not lend"" shelf as i value my friends and wouldn't consider them subjecting them to such gory nonsense.

"
1627,"this book is a personal re-examination of food--what we eat, and why we eat it. in this book, prentice examines food customs and traditions, searching for their physiological and environmental rationale.  her primary observation about food traditions is that they are strictly tied to the seasons, and thus the continual year-round availability of our foodstuffs has resulted in loss of much traditional knowledge about what is good for us and what isn't.  in recognition of the essential seasonality of foods, prentice organizes this book into the thirteen moons that make up the year, from the famine moon, to the sap moon, from the egg moon to the corn moon, from the blood moon to the wolf moon.  

each chapter describes the ecology that led to the association between a particular food item and a specific time of the year.  in the chapters, prentice discusses the nutritional contributions of the featured food items, and how her relationship with that food has changed over the years.  for example, she explains how she used to avoid milk and other dairy products, but now relishes them as a gift of love from mother earth.  each chapter also includes recipes of the season, ranging from exotic dishes of non-western food cultures, like cardamom and jaggery pudding, to simple directions for lost arts, such as rendering pork, or making homemade yogurt and sauerkraut.  

prentice was once a strict vegan, who for health reasons, eventually found herself drawn to a diet which includes animal products, but not the products of industrial agriculture. there is much that vegetarians and vegans would not like in prentice's essays, since she explains how her 10 years of vegetarianism were not healthy for her.  having had the same experience myself after being a vegetarian for 20 years, i can appreciate the wisdom in what she writes.  while vegetarian diets work well for some, they are not appropriate for everybody.  but at the same time, diets that include the consumption of industrially produced and processed animal products do nobody any good.  we need to be willing to recognize our relation and responsibilities to the animals that we consume.

i first heard of this book when i attended a vermont localvore potluck at which prentice was the invited guest chef.  i was deeply offended then at her attitude, when she announced she was going to make a salad using a recipe from her book, but lamented the lack of local artichokes or olive oil.  `how could such a person be associated with local cooking,' i wondered, `if she doesn't even have the sense to find out what the best local ingredients are and celebrate them, instead of parading the products of another region in front of us?'  i figured that a seasonal local cookbook written by a national author would be a worthless concept.  fortunately, that's not what this book attempts--instead the book is much more about rediscovering our connection to food than about specific local recipes.

although she has become famous for leading the concept of eating foods only from one's local region, what she urges here is really an appreciation for the products of small farms.  thus, instead of simply cheering on local food, prentice argues in this book that our industrial agriculture system has torn us away from one of the most essential of human traits, our relationship to the food that nourishes us.  instead of following diets of avoidance, prentice advocates recognizing the meaning that each item of food brings to our lives, and using food to re-establish our connection to the land.  indeed, the only foods that prentice avoids are those heavily processed products of industrial agriculture: refined sugar, white flour, and pre-packaged extruded junk.  although the book contains a few recipes, it is not a cookbook, but rather a wake-up call: ""our poor diet is at least partly a physical manifestation of a spiritual decay,"" together with some suggestions of how we can begin the journey back to healthy eating
"
1794,"ironweed by william j. kennedy was the latest selection for a book club i've recently joined.  the premise of the club is to read a novel and then view the movie (at the group meeting) that was based on the novel.  as i expected, the movie paled in comparison to the book, despite the screenplay being written by kennedy himself.  jack nicholson plays the main character (francis) and meryl streep is his ""wanna be"" socialite girlfriend (helen), but this star power doesn't elevate the story beyond what kennedy had already done in the novel.

set during the ""great depression,"" ironweed is a great look at the underbelly of society: drunks, homeless, impoverished, and in that regard the story is timeless.  i enjoyed the characters' quirkiness and the loosely connected plots, but more significantly to me were the themes of redemption, forgiveness, and love.  the love aspect may be hard to spot, but it is there, unconventionally, in many of the character's interactions.

this favorable recommendation comes with a warning: it can be a depressing read, definitely not a happy one, and while i found it inspirational, it will not conjure any blithe emotions.  ironweed is definitely not a june beach read, being more apropos to a long winter night, indoor, by a warm fire.

1642,"in the commencement mr. utterson and his cousin mr. richard enfield were walking throughout london. the men go by a mysterious cellar door, and then mr. enfield talked about a story that ensue here previously. also later in the book utterson work to help dr. jekyll from being brung into the ghastly tribulations of mr. hydes. one year later, edward hyde viciously murders sir danvers carew by thrashing him to death with a cane. 
i did not like this book because it was a high level booklover so i could not concentrate. i'd propose this book for high scholar for that reason, and if you're a person who reads allot. the genre was good because it was sci-fi and it seems sci-fi is a little more addicting. the author is a pretty well known writer his name is robert louis stevenson.
"
97,"i am a jew living in a college town in mississippi for the past 5 years. i was born & raised in the north. i think evans should rename his book ""fiddler on the roof in the south"". his book is a very nostalgic look back at jewish history - as it was in the past here. it's very much: the southern jews were all so happy, they all fit in and were accepted, etc. he does cite a few instances where they had problems - but these usually involved us 'yankee jews', like the instances when a few (yankee)rabbis in the south fought for civil rights. 
evans should realize that times have really changed here! the evangelical christians in my town (which is most people here) harrass me like crazy - 'i am praying for you!' 'have you read the words of jesus, who was a jew like you?' 'when will you come to my church'. blah, blah, blah. thank god for the minority of catholics, methodists, presbyterians and a few others who live here. they are the only ones to accept me for the way i am, and the way i will stay - a jew. 
i want all who are reading this to realize that i am only speaking for my experience. jews who reside in cities in the south have told me that they have had far better experiences, and that they cannot relate to what i am saying.
but i do want to ask evans a few questions:
1) if things are so great for the jews in the south: why have you lived in new york for decades now???
2) why don't you at least write either a new forward to the book, a magazine article, etc., contrasting some of the ways in which the lives of jews in the south have changed over time (for some of us at least), primarily due to the rise of the evangelical christians?
i read evans' books before i moved here, and nothing much he describes in his books is my life here. for a jew who really cares about her/his religion living here is depressing; it is practically jew-less; and, at best, the majority of a certain denomination of christians here ignore me. (by the way, i am planning to move to a city!)
by the way, don't bother writing to me to tell me that i am ""wrong"", or to invite me to things like the bible study at your church. believe me, with all the praying for me that is going on in this town, and all the myriad attempts to convert me, if it hasn't happened by now, as they say in these parts, it just ain't gonna happen
"
1486,"as a 6th grader i think i had this book permanently checked out of my school's library for the entire year. great adventure and suspense, a fascinating look into another culture, an extraordinarily brave girl and  her love for her dog, and a deeply satisfying ending -- a perfect  combination. i'm so glad it's still in print
"
55,"i've skimmed a number of popular books published in the last few years on the problem of sexless marriage, and this is by far most interesting contribution to date. first, there is no recommendations for drug therapy anywhere in the book. second, the author frequently brings into the discussion a european-influenced view of some particularly american style predilictions and assumptions reguarding sex, parenthood, gender politics, and relationship expectations. 

her fundamental premise is that eroticisim requires seprateness, and in the course of building and sustaining security, we can frequently lose the ""me"" and ""you"" in us. but even more important, she sees the very contemporary marital impulse toward an egalitarian union -- while great for chores and child care -- can be a neutralizer in the bedroom.  

you may or may not find strands of your own dilemma in her case histories, but you will not walk away from them empty handed, either. 

there are many aspects of the book which are highly nuanced, and won't survive well in the o'reilly world of broadcast media interviews. i can just hear some producer-fed talking head asking something like, ""you advocate couples go to vegas for swinging? why?"" (she doesn't). so don't pay attention to that noise. this is an intellegent, respectful, contemplative work of original thinking that confronts a subject too often approached with superlatives and pabulum.

buy one for yourself and one for your best friend -- more than likely, they're suffering, too

43,"i can not stand this book. i can't even finish reading it. kevin j anderson can not write original star wars books at all. the only thing i have ever seen with his name on it that was entertaining was the dark lords of the sith comic book. everything he writes is unoriginal and lacking in story. he seems to have some obsession with death stars and world destroyers because all he seems to put in his books are those. darksaber, jedi search, dark apprentice, champions of the force, heck even the ig-88 story he wrote for tales of the bounty hunters had the death star tied in (ig-88 transfers himself into the death star...what the heck?) seriously, this book is not worth it. try timothy zahn or michael stackpole. at least they don't always use death stars. and while zahn's last 3 books are based around thrawn, the original heir to the empire, dark force rising and the last command, when thrawn first appeared, was not him dry humping the same concept over and over
"
1802,"while i realize that the majority of people thought this to be a stellar book, it reminds me of the story, ""the emperor has no clothes"".  yes, choan can write a beautiful sentence and yes, the first several pages were intriguing but the switching of years was very annoying.  the ""flipping back and forth"" was not accomplished in a smooth, flowing manner.  in addition, the subject matter was incredibly depressing and the characters were so flawed that one did not even care about how their lives evolved.  the kidnapping was predictable and the ending contrived.  it would be impossible to recommend this book to anyone

1453,"this book (i believe) is one of lem's earlier stories and it reads like so-so pulp sci-fi. fiasco (a true 5 star science fiction novel) picks up the idea of contacting a new world and does it so much better. i suggest reading this only if you are a lem completist (i've read all of his stuff except 2 books)

1655,"after reading this book, it was apparent to me that the author was implying that nixon was a dark and grumpy man who needed his image repackaged.  mcginnis boasts of nixon and his pr teams ability to hide the &quot;true&quot; nixon and to trick the public into voting for his image.  he proclaims that the real nixon was the one that the country saw debating kennedy on tv in 1960.  nothing could be further from the truth.  first off, nixon won the 1960 election but did not contest the results for the good of the nation.  all historians admit that jfk had help from daily in illinois and lbj in texas.  furthermore, in the 1960 debates, nixon had a high fever and was recently out of the hospitable and jfk's staff broke into the basement of the studio and turned up the heat to make him sweat! if anyone decieved the voters with his image, it was jfk using his dramatic but bubbly rhetoric and not backing it up and jfk the family man and the idealist.  jfk exploited the missile gap, had numerous affairs, assassinated ngo dihn diem, wire tapped martin luther king, screwed up the bay of pigs, and had ties to the mafia!  now, i could be wrong, but jfk's campaign sounds like a true selling of the president.  'selling of the president' has little credible content but infact is a good historical document that portrays left wing propaganda of the 1960s
"
1767,"with relations between the west and the islamic world worsening rapidly, a better understanding of islam and its roots is badly needed in the west.  

one major barrier between understanding islamic culture is the key sacred text, the q'uran, has been little studied in the west, and until recently, good translations were unavailable.  many qurans were translated into the same sort of english as the king james bible, and not a glint of the quran's revevered poetic beauty was reflected in such translations.

thankfully, better translations in modern english are being made by leading islamic scholars who have a more sensitive ear to the poetry of the quran, as well as a better understanding of the influence and appeal this text has for believing muslims.  

like all great works of literature, especially a poetic one like the quran, its power and beauty can only be appreciated in its original language.  this is why muslims often say the quran is untranslateable, but when one hears a verse of the quran being sung aloud with a little knowledge of arabic, the beauty (while unfortunately not fully understandable) does start to become apparent.  

but, even in translation, when read carefully the quran still has great beauty from a literary viewpoint.  the most beautiful part of the quran in my view is the 'light' surah, which compares god to a light whose glory fills the entire cosmos.  this surah has been a favourite with sufis, islamic theologians like al-ghazzali, and also muslim philosophers as well.  

while the quran does contain descriptions of violence and its style is often difficult to read for the westerner, it is important to study this work with patience and try and see it as an organic whole rather than a fragmented jumble of poems.  it is in this sense the deep underlying unity of the quran and its theology (which reflects the unity of allah, the divinity in islam) becomes apparent, especially in the names of god.  

a good knowledge of this religious classic is becoming indispensible in a world where islam is becoming more important to understand from a global perspective

1034,"it seems as if it is impossible for a.s byatt to write a bad or even a mediocre story. after this novel, she is one of my new absolute favorites and i have vowed to read everything this amazing author has written. 
i began to read the virgin in the garden, and could not put it down. i was enraptured by the beautiful descriptions of the two contrasting ""elizabethian ages"" and the characters. frederica has to be one of the most despicable, and yet intriguing literary characters in years. my breath was also taken away by the story of marcus potter--a haunting, amazing character that will stay with you for days. 
the way byatt writes, she transports you to 1950s england and the lives of the potters. i felt as if i knew these characters like family, and could almost sit down to lunch with them by the end of the book. her style, timing, and subtle metaphors of passion and life are irresistible and amazing. this is truly a writer who will stand the test of time to become an icon in the likes of the brontes, jane austen, and kate chopin. 
i cannot wait to share this book with everyone i know. highly, highly reccomended. go to the bookstore or your local library, ignore the new glossy bestsellers that try and cheat you out of your money and instead pick up this gorgeous, powerful read that new authors cannot hold a candle to.

922,"the plot is good but there are about 200 pages too many.  why a full chapter to tell us what the protagonists are thinking about the attach case, when we already know it was not in the car and we could tell them where it is? we know where the precious document is : another useless quest. people are murdered by the half dozen, the characters are outrageous, most of the time improbable, and i felt the semi-erotic swimming episode totally stupid, not to mention the girl apologizing constantly about it.

1222,"18 jun 2005

as the book progressed, it got more and more egoistic, to the point where it becomes a turn-off towards the end of the book. i am surprised that there was so little mentioned of hakeem. shaq's attitude seems to be that since he can score, he does not respect centers who can't score. whereas he respect bill russell. but he does give kobe his fair share of spotlight. the other book i read was an unabashed hype of shaq, so this is a big improvement.

1954,"the topic of this book is very interesting: espionage in the revolutionary war. unfortunately, ""washington's spies"" goes into so much nit-picking detail that, as the cliche goes, you can't see the forest for the trees. to really get anything out of this book, you'd have to be a *very* dedicated revolutionary war buff. it didn't have much appeal at all to me as a general reader.

1186,"""being a lover of freedom, when the [nazi] revolution came, i looked to the universities to defend it, knowing that they had always boasted of their devotion to the cause of truth; but no, the universities were immediately silenced. then i looked to the great editors of the newspapers, whose flaming editorials in days gone had proclaimed their love of freedom; but they, like the universities, were silenced in a few short weeks.... only the church stood squarely across the path of hitler's campaign for suppressing the truth. i never had any special interest in the church before, but now i feel a great affection and admiration for it because the church alone has had the courage and persistence to stand for intellectual and moral freedom. i am forced to confess that what i once despised i now praise unreservedly."" 
-- albert einstein. 

what i'm getting at here is that you can propogate anyone to look bad, that's easy. when you have two sources contradicting each other so heavily, you may want to consider the source; i.e a protestant british author writing over fifty years after the fact, vice a prominent and liberal jewish figure who lived through the holcaust and has no biased motive to either slander or praise the beforementioned institution.

or maybe israel zolli, chief rabbi of rome whose conversion to catholicism immediately after the war was prompted by the church's reaction to the plight of the jewish people. 

this book is extremely propagated and heavily editorialized. it is important to read a work like this however, in order to better understand the manipulation of truth and half truth in the author's motive

430,"the scientific method applied to this book:

1) form a hypothesis:  great managers do something differently than mediocre managers.
2) conduct an experiment:  interview 80,000 managers.
3) analyze data: ???this step is missing???
4) draw conclusions: write this book.

with the exception of the ""12 questions"", the authors make no attempt to back any their conclusions with the results of their study.  they make several insightful statements, such as ""many managers say they would like to define the right outcomes.""  however, they do not even attempt to tell the reader how the study led them to this statement.  did 90% of the managers interviewed state this?  did 60% of the great managers state this while only 10% of the mediocre managers did?  does ""many managers"" mean 100 managers?  100 managers seems like ""many managers"" at first, but considering 80,000 were interviewed i 100 managers is a negligible amount.  the entire book consists of several rational statements that are not supported by their study.  

it seems to me that after conducting a huge study to find out what great managers do differently, the authors found almost no common trends.  however, since they put a lot of money and effort into conducting the study, they needed something to show for it and wrote this book.  if buckingham and coffman didn't claim this book was a result of ""the largest study of its kind,"" i would say it offers some decent advice;  however, since it does make this claim, i wish they would have back up their conclusions so the readers would be able to determine how valid they are.

1062,"i enjoy reading books of trivia and fun facts, but i didn't even make it through the first chapter before i put this book down in disgust. almost every entry had to do with sex or male endowments. as i was flipping through the book, i found x-rated pictures and drawings that i would hate to have to explain to my children if they were to pick up this book. i never would have bought this book if i had seen it in a bookstore, and i regret throwing it in the trash before i could see if i could get my money back

508,"while this book is not a comprehensive volume, it does cover the most common landscape plants in the virginia landscape. there is a strong emphasis on older varieties of plants and those that are best suited to the climate conditions of virginia.

for a new resident of virginia who likes to do amatuer landscaping, this book is indispensible

161,"this book gave me insight into german culture. it is no wonder 
there was a holocaust with children's books like these. max and moritz are adventurous children and they are caught. being caught isn't enough. they are ground in a flour mill for punishment. not even that suits the miller. he feeds their remains to the ducks. it instantly reminded me of concentration camp victims being cremated and then turned into soap. this story will forever give nightmares

1806,"this was required reading for my british literature class. it's the only novel in the class that i struggled with and only struggled from boredom. it is entirely possible that i just do not understand the genius that is forster, but i did not enjoy this novel. a lover of forster or modernist writing might enjoy it more. it must be a classic for a reason.
"
1059,"as a complete newbie to xml this was a good starter.  as i got deeper into xml i found several mistakes/deficiencies in the book, and sometimes the author just flat out seemed to not know what he was talking about.  for instance, the claim on page 86 that (#cdata) is a valid dtd element content definition is flat out wrong.  his description of schema element declarations (pp. 114-115) teaches that using globals/refs is the only way to define complex elements, and is inappropriate for his example.  he makes no mention of globals at all, leaving the reader confused.  i have ceased to trust this book as a valid source of xml information
"
1026,"i have been slogging through this book for weeks now, it was a terrible shock to the system after john julius norwich's excellent book on byzantium.  the book lacks any narrative thrust, often stopping and retreading events slightly out of chronological order and frequently bringing all forward motion to a halt by describing the intricacies of some bureaucratic office or another.  the one consistent thing throughout this book is the author's obvious agenda to ""set the record straight"" and prove that the ottoman empire was far superior to its ""barbaric"" european contemporaries
"
432,"i read this book with an open mind.  i am familiar with the tremendous criticism that has arisen from claims that survivors of child abuse may use their backgrounds to claim some sort of privileged status.  in a few cases, i think this criticism may be legitimate; in other cases, not.  so i was interested to see if there were perhaps legitimate reasons to criticize survivors of the holocaust or their advocates in the jewish community.  

(note:  i am not equating child abuse and the holocaust.  i am saying that when people speak up about terrible things, there is often a tendency to see them as whiners who are shirking their responsibilities.  all things do not have to be equally terrible to promote this societal reaction.)

i didn't find anything in this book to convince me of that.  what i found was to me an unconvincing and highly subjective summary of the jewish reaction to the holocaust, in which the author claims that it did not become a big deal until a long time after it was over, and that it was made into a big deal for illegitimate reasons, but this discussion is so subjective and brief that i was not persuaded to adopt his point of view.  

the bulk of the book consists of complaints that jewish organizations unfairly extorted money from countries such as switzerland.  the argument becomes fairly technical here and evaluating it is beyond me because i have never read the reports (""audits,"" etc.) to which the author refers.  but i think that focusing so narrowly on money misses the point.  i expected to see a general discussion of the ways in which the author alleges that an emphasis on the holocaust caused some jews to ""play the victim card,"" and what i got was a very indepth discussion of several fights about money about which i have no way of determining the truth of the author's allegations.

to me it seems obvious that the holocaust was a terrible atrocity with devastating consequences for the jews, and many lives were destroyed or damaged as a result.  it seems reasonable to me that the jewish community would insist that society recognize the destruction and damage, and to the extent that this book detracts from this, i think it is unfortunate

1556,"turn of the century continues to serve a most useful purpose, months after i gave up on it. i have a door that rattles if it's not wedged open and t-o-c is just big enough and heavy enough to do the job on its own. i struggled, oh how i struggled to try and even begin to understand some of the characters. i stirred the pages wildly while i waited for the plot to thicken. i fought against closing eyelids while the book became heavier and heavier. i searched my abridged guide to good grammar to see if i had missed a couple of chapters explaining that sentences after all don't need a subject, a verb and an object - or even a permutation of two out of three. i left it on the front doorstep hoping somebody would steal it. i offered it to my  neighbor so he could jack up his car. i considered lighting the fire with it. i wondered whether, if i took just a few pages a day, i could eat it and get rid of the evidence. i offered it to my mother-in-law for christmas. i took it scuba diving with me instead of a weight belt. and then, eventually, voila! the rattling door! what a fine tome t-o-c is. another few hundred pages [...] and i could have used it as a sea anchor for the titanic

1584,"started out a bit slow and built into a real action packed thriller.  several times i found myself saying, ""oh yuk!""  nevertheless the story line was fabulously interesting and you'll fall in love especially with thomas, a down syndrome young man with a special gift.  this is another great story by koontz. 
"
1328,"i thought this book would be great and was really looking forward to making some of the recipes, but i have to admit i'm disappointed with the recipes and with what i've baked from it so far.  i was surprised that so many of the recipes called for vegetable shortening instead of or in addition to butter.  i know the book itself explains that shortening is used to achieve a certain texture, but i have read in other baking books that shortening is a crutch and doesn't deliver the flavor punch of pure butter.

so i was a little skeptical, and then reading through the recipes, although they are very clearly written, there aren't a lot of extra tips on technique or anything for individual recipes.  the book already assumes a level of competence.

i made three recipes from the book: the essential chewy sugar cookie, the essential chewy chocolate chip cookie, and the fudgy brownies.  all three recipes tasted delicious, so i can't complain there, but the brownies came out a little tough for my tastes, and both the cookies spread too much -- way too much, and i even refrigerated the dough for the sugar cookies. i consider myself to be an intermediate baker and have made these cookies from other recipes in the past with better results, so right now i'm wondering if i should even try any more of the recipes in this book or just give up.  i think it's okay for a ""base"" cookie recipe book, but you would need to look elsewhere for better techniques or to tweak the ingredients
"
810,"if you like fantasy and are not acquainted with the works of andre norton, then this is an excellent starting point.  believable, heroic characters and a well thought-out &quot;witch world&quot; combine to make for an enjoyable read.  simon tregarth is transported through a mysterious gate into a world populated by people and other things not people.  a struggle goes on between good and evil, and it's not clear who is winning.  (but, we know who wins in the end - &quot;good&quot;, of course.)  the style of writing - more of a story that unfolds as it is read - is one strength that characterizes her writings.  that, and the fascinating settings, imaginative perils faced, and strong likable characters make this a &quot;must read&quot;.  this is a refreshing hard-to-put-down story.  it does not suffer from the typical overinflated, overwordy, overcomplicated, and overcharacterized (and lifeless) features of the usual fantasy megathon offered today
"
1276,"i did a fast skimming through this book and noticed that for an essential monster movie guide, it certainly doesn't praise or hype the genre that well. this book comes across like it was written by an elitist who's too good for horror. nearly every movie/special gets a low rating and i can't understand why a book like this that could've been a good companion to the horror fan would be so anti-horror as a whole. horror fans, in general, want to be be entertained and or scared...i for one don't want logical stories and things that make sense if it detracts from the entertainment factor because typically what makes sense and uses logic in horror is boring. it gets 2 stars from me because it offers a diverse selection of films and includes mini biographies of horror legends like vincent price, christopher lee, peter cushing, lon chaney, boris karloff, etc. but for a horror movie book, the writers certainly didn't help their genre by bad-mouthing it so much in this book
"
1388,"i have read several of hiaasen's books and loved them.  they were very funny.  this one is not.  it is an endless description of naked strippers.  i found the main character, erin, to be very unappealing.  she is just so stupid.  her problems are all of her own creation.  and she is not funny.  i think you have to be a man to like this book.  i, as a woman, just found it exceedingly boring.  i kept waiting for it to get funny.  it never did

1577,"book is totally disorganized.  beautiful pictures, but no way of researching values.  the price list is in the back organized by lot no & auction no.  no reference to the illustration of the marbles in the front of the book, no way to look it up.  starts out promising, then becomes a total jumble.  totally impossible to locate anything.  too time consuming, and then still no resolve

611,"i have introduced many of my ell, high school students to lois lowery and the depth of her characters. she is a brilliant writer and capable of inspiring fierce passion in her readers as they encounter shocking details of her utopian worlds. i was anxious to read this companion novel and had planned to share it with my class this january. although the series is written for 6th graders and older, this book's simplicity, in its message, language and writing style will inspire no one.  i am sadly disappointed

1126,"this book has some of the most unique ideas for spending quality time with your mate. it has all the dates organized into categories based on how much time you have, how much money you want to spend, etc. then at the end of each date there are questions and focus excerises to bridge a communication gap
"
1694,"i have progressively become more and more disappointed with rita mae brown's books in the past decade. her early books were utterly magnificent; now, she rarely if ever deviates from her favorite (and by now, utterly boring) themes -- southern manners, horse bloodlines, and foxhunting. blessedly, ""whisker of evil"" was foxhunting-free, but suffered from a heavy-handed overload of the previous two. rita mae brown would be wise to remember that there is a big world outside of her corner of virginia, and many of us have grace, manners, and respect for others -- and we don't take kindly to being told that only virginians understand these things. that's just simply not true.

that said, there were some delightful aspects of ""whisker of evil"" -- the mystery itself was great, the animal characters were adorable as ever, and i loved learning more about harry as a person and what makes her tick. her quitting the post office was a great (and very unexpected) twist. i liked reading more about her home and her relationships. however, the stultifying minutiae of horse bloodlines was beyond me; was this directed at a heretofore-unknown segment of rita mae brown's fan base? it was so out of context in this book; certain details contributed to the horses' relationships to one another, but she took it way too far and i found myself skipping pages. as well, i almost threw the book across the room when i came across a line that stated in so many words that only virginians have manners. this is a common theme of ms. brown's and it is quite frankly offensive. there is a big, big world outside of virginia -- rita mae brown should know this, she has lived in it -- but her books and characters have become so parochial, insular and snobbish that it is an insult to those of us who do live elsewhere in that big world. i would have thought these kinds of statements were tongue-in-cheek if it wasn't such a recurring theme in so many of her books over the past decade. enough already about southern manners (a biased perception at best), ancestor worship, bloodlines (human and horse), and foxhunting.

"
617,"this is an enlightening, meticulous story of william ""boss"" tweed and, as past of the context, his three key cronies in the ring: peter sweeny, richard connolly and oakley hall. it is a story about how the new york times elevated itself by getting the goods on corruption and bravely exposing it on the front page. oh how the mighty have fallen!

the time of power (terror?) for tweed's edition of tammany hall was relatively short, but tammany hall power lingered well after tweed's demise, another eithy-five years. the critical moment to the story is when tweed engineers the proverbial license to steal by devising a new charter for new york city, putting the power in the hands of his incredibly greedy ring of thieves. the four took this opportunity to carve out a fortune for themselves, primarily by paying millions of dollars for a courthouse that should have cost a few hundred thousand to build. a disgruntled 'whistleblower' (the term had no meaning back then) copied over the records in enough detail to demonstrate the bold theft and fraud. there are several versions of how the blockbuster story of the padded expenses and outright theft came into the times' hands, but the remarkable part of the story is just how brazen the ""ring"" could be, how convinced they were of their own invincibility or ability to bribe, cheat and steal their way out of any legal investigation or hearings. people who today believe we live in an era of unbridled corporate greed and ethical lapses need to read this book to better understand how much the supposed watchdog and people's friend -- the government -- can be part of the problem and a barrier to the solution.

the cast of characters, sinners, (few) saints, and masses of immigrants makes following the flow of the book sometimes a challenging task. thomas nast, a pivotal character if not the hero of the book, provides some vivid, visual signposts. nast not only draws a compelling picture for often illiterate 'readers', he was one of the first to put a face on public figures who heretofore had not been subjected to portraits or paparazzi as are today's politicians. nast's giving tweed a face may have been one of the breakthrough aspects of this story. it certainly helped catch tweed when he jumped bail. a few maps, perhaps some old drawings, and even a list of key characters could have perhaps clarified some of the story or reduced my thumbing back to previous pages or checking the index for the entry and bio of important members of the cast. there are some historic new york times front page stories that help create atmosphere and context.

any reasonably educated american should have learned at least the sketchy details of tweed's nefarious deeds and nast's colorful cartoons. ackerman does an excellent job of documenting and detailing, filling in the gaps, and bringing now faded, black-and-white characters back to life
"
101,"i ordered this book primarily for the benefit of my 7 year old son. we're doing a research project on oceans, and while we have a few good resources, i felt this one, with its 3d imagery, would more likely capture and hold his attention. what i didn't realize was how thoroughly it would capture and hold mine. for me, 3d had always meant multicolored plastic glasses and headaches. though the book was described as stereoscopic, i didn't understand what that meant. stereography was something new for me, even if as a form of photography it is over 150 years old. 

this is not a matter of red and blue separations; the 3d results from the human eye's trick of blending 2 photos taken (simultaneously) an eye's width apart.  photographer mark blum is a pioneer in the art of underwater 3d photography, and his work is beautifully displayed here.  everyone i've shown this book to has been fascinated by it, and i fully expect that when we've finished with our project the book will find its way to permanent display in my home

1412," i liked the book but you also have to consider the end killer... is that logical at all?? the senator is in his late fifties and so how old is his father? if he had the senator when he was twenty he'd have to be 77. is it really reasonable that he's running around killing people, and setting houses on fire. it was a very unlikely twist to the end. it still was a good book

1109,"my boy ejd is back, and so am i!  keeping it real, i took an eric jerome dickey hiatus.  for years he held a special spot on my shelf as my favorite author, hands down.  then it happened...his books just weren't doing it for me anymore.  call in change, call it growth, falling off, call it whatever, but i wasn't feeling it.  drive me crazy drove me crazy and i couldn't finish it.  unheard of for me.  chasing destiny came, but i let her run right past me.  however, the title of his new release piqued my interest, so i decided to give it a shot and i am glad i did.
 
death is life.  gideon is a freelance hit man.  in the seedy underbelly of death for hire, gideon is know as a man of talent and business; a profitable business.  he has a goal that he is trying to reach and with this acceptance of his most recent job, he just may obtain it.  this job could put him over the edge financially and literally.  has the hunter become the hunted?
 
sleeping with strangers is a smartly written, great reading drama/thriller that showcases dickey's talent.  he blended success, style and heartlessness.  then he added some ruthlessness, deceit and trickery.  let's not forget murder, mayhem and steamy sex scenes.  my hiatus is officially over.  i enjoyed sws.  now i`m at the door, looking out the peephole waiting on the sequel to arrive
"
1906,"black metropolis is perhaps the founding document of african-american studies, a classic work of sociology that still resonates today. it is a paradigmatic expression of the chicago school of sociology, however, a  school that today stands in some disrepute, at least in some circles.  indirectly, it was the target of james baldwin's famous attack on richard  wright in his essay, everybody's protest novel. the claim of the criticism  has been that the chicago school, due to its insistance upon using a  &quot;scientific approach&quot;, merely reproduces the very terms under  which african-americans have been oppressed--a claim that has proceeded  under the warrant of european intellectuals such as theodor adorno. still,  black metropolis is a landmark study, and, unfortunately, many if not most  of its observations and conclusions remain true today, and in fact it could  be argued that conditions in the black belt of chicago have gotten worse,  not better, since 1945, the year of black metropolis' publication--which  lends a certain credence to the criticisms mentioned above, though perhaps  it should be qualified by saying that they are not so much criticisms of  the chicago school as they are criticisms of american society. since then,  as we know, we have witnessed a great shift in american public opinion away  from what some consider to be the excesses of those days; so much so, in  fact, that the work of black metropolis may again be regarded as a  profoundly useful book. embodying american liberalism as it does--which  counted as a grave sin thirty years ago--black metropolis may possibly be  due for a fresh look
"
1164,"this book reveiw is on a book named last summer with maizon.  this book is about two best friends named margarate and maizon who lives on madison street.  her friend maizon was accepted to blue hills, a school where really educated people go.  margarate does not want them to be separated.  every night she wishes maizon will not get accepted.  but when margarate's father has a second heart attack, he dies and now all margarate has is maizon, her mother, her little brother jay and the people around.  margarete was having a rough time anyway and then maizon got accepted to blue hills.  when it was time for maizon to leave margarate, her mother and maizon's grandmother dropped her off.  when maizon wasn't there with margarate her whole life changed.  at school she was becoming popular, she was liked now.  days passed by and maizon still didn't call.  when margarate went to go get her brother at her neighbors house, that's when maizon calls.  margarate was so excited that maizon wanted to come home.  margarate ran to the grandmother's house telling her the news.  margarate said maizon wants to come home, the grandmother says that she would go get her.  when maizon got home it was like old times, they ran into each others arms.  they then went to their favorite spot and started talking.  maizon said she came back because she wasn't being treated right, she didn't feel the same. so they sat there and talked and felt like old times with my best friend maizon.  i think that this book should have gotten an award or five stars.  this book has mostly everything of real life.  it deals with best friends, for example like my friendship with kiena.  it has separation, like my sister and me.  it has a lost loved one like my godfather and it has a lesson like when you do wrong and learn your lesson.  i think that this book should have five stars because it really relates to real life,it shows friendship and it shows and explains what happens in real life.  i like this book because it reminds me of my life, me and my friends, how we argue and lose our friendship and then gain it back with a little talking.  it reminds me of how i lose people in my family and then cry because i miss them.  if i could buy this book, i would let my whole family read it, i would make it our reference book for when we need advice or something to do.  this book is so good that all my friends wanted to read it.  it is so good that i really read it because i don't really read books and when i read the book it made me think of when my best friend ariel was going to move and how it made me feel, and how i compare it to margarate and maizon.  this book is excellent, the author really put their heart in it and that they were depressed and needed a friend.  if you ask my best friend johnniece, she'll say that she really enjoyed the book, that it should get five stars, because the author really put thought, confidence, respect, love, care and her whole heart into this book.  when i say she put confidence in this book i meant that she wrote it knowning that it will be a hit.  the author thought about the words, thought her life and compared it and started writing it with compassion.  i think that this book should be the book of the month in my school, because it shows and teaches a lesson.  with the summary i wrote i put my heart in it because when i read it, it touched my heart.  i won't want my friend away from me.  i think that i mostly relate to maizon, because when she left margarte was beginning to be liked, and the girl was talking about maizon and margarte sat there and watched and listened instead of doing the right thing and telling them to stop doing that to their friend.  i relate to maizon, i relate to her because if people don't like me, i don't care.  if people want me out of somewhere, then i'll leave and if people love me, i love them back and that's how maizon is.  she doesn't take junk.  alot of people relate to maizon.  this book is interesting and gets interesting as you read on.  this book is really a good book that shows you friendship, break-up and everything else that deals with real life.  i love this book, it is really good and i think that if most people had this book then they wouldn't be out doing the stupid and illegal things that they are doing.  this book really didn't grasp dr. kings dream because when maizon went to blue hills, the whites were treating her bad, they saw her different.  brenliniqua, class 7-512

1780,"i first purchased this book when i was a freshman in college seven years ago. it is without a doubt the best and easiest reference guide to writing i have ever read.  i love the plastic tabs that mark each section.  this guide is easy to read and follow it is organized in basic steps that are categorized accourding to section.  so for example if you need to find out how to cite a web page or a video tape, etc using the mla style you just flip to the section called doucmentation clearly marked with a plastic tab.  i have since purchased an updated guide for myself and also bought one for my brother - a freshman in college.  i really wish i had this book when i was in high school.  i highly recommend this book to any high school, college, graduate student or writer.  i especially recomend this book for students with learning disabilities, i myself have add and before i got this guide i could not understand how to write a paper in the mla style or in any style other than a book report.  i promise this is the easiest reference guide to writing ever published

1595,"this book is truly lovely--about finding friendship in the most unexpected of places. i cannot imagine anyone not enjoying it immensely (and you won't get tired of reading it to your kids either)
"
759,"i forced myself to finish this book before i reviewed it, and being through with it now, i feel as though i've learned very little.  i had so many problems with this book, or rather the way of writing, mostly stemming from the completely pompous arrogance of the author, that this was a difficult read.  in his defense, he is, in most things, very thorough.  my main and overwhelming problem with this book was that the author was arrogant enough to believe that he could relay what leonardo was (or as he sometimes put it &quot;must have been&quot;) thinking or feeling.  while i give mr. bramly credit as a man very much versed in his subject, in my opinion, that still gives him no right to use what i understood to be a faithful biography as a place to put forward his own views.  since he himself stresses that leonardo's famous notebooks contain little to no personal thoughts or feelings, he has no basis for those statements and they are only his overconfident postulations.  in the instances that there is a controversy over some area of leonardo's life, the author is very good about stating that there is a dispute regarding the matter, but only puts forward his own opinion, and his reasons why he believes what he does, without explaining the opposite side of the matter.  in this manner, he forces his thoughts on the reader without leaving them any choice in the matter.  sentences beginning with &quot;i think&quot; or &quot;in my view&quot; are not uncommon.  he also makes certain assumptions about the reader, referring often to other artists' works with the assumption that the reader is as knowledgeable as he is about them.  also, he occasionally goes into great detail regarding a painting or drawing of leonardo's, often drawing attention to coloring or texture, without ever showing it, though the book has many drawings and paintings throughout.  the author is an undoubtedly intelligent, well-learned man, very erudite where leonardo da vinci is concerned, but entirely overbearing in his writing.  overall, unless you are well versed in the renaissance artists and don't mind being pulled out of a book by the author's views, then i would highly suggest staying away from this one
"
1541,"normally i like the entire ""female power"" thing but frankly the ""this is wrong"" or ""evil"" part of that storyline is really old.  in an era where girls do try out for and get placed on ""boys"" teams, these issues seem outdated.  likewise rules were recently changed in indiana (not even slightly a liberal state) that says any pageant receiving state funds cannot discriminate on the basis of sex or gender.  i know, this book is from 1999, but we are living in a conservative backlash politically and this is still happening, changes are happening.  overall i felt the book had a very negative view of the gender roles and did not do anything to suggest they should be different.  even the disempowered girl who creates the initial problems with her ""magic"" is empowered through a pageant and her cooking.  how much more gender role enforcement can we have?  really, with a strong female lead, shouldn't a buffy universe story do better than this?  in general the feel of the relationships and lingo between the main characters was fine but not particularly outstanding
"
1803,"a favourite writer goes to prison, keeps a diary which proves to be an enjoyable read, then, upon his release, writes the worst book of his career. the concept of the book is good, as is the idea to blend the characters into the 9-11 tragedy. the first 20 pages flow with typical archer style. then the characters begin to make a series of continuously irrational decisions.

my personnal favourite is when 2 characters independantly consider driving either to canada or mexico in order to fly to europe during the 9-11 grounding of air traffic. the idea that new yorkers wouldn't know that montreal is the nearest international airport seem laughable. while there is a direct highway to montreal, archer sends the main character to toronto which reqires a least 6 different highway changes, is in the wrong direction and nearly twice the drive. once at the border, the border patrol guard turns out to be a world class art historian who apparantly doesn't know that mcgill university is in montreal not toronto as is claimed by our hero. the guard then remarks that he will ""meet"" a collegue of the hero when that peron travels up to the conference. the idea that only one border guard is working the dozens of eastern us/canadian border crossings, with multi-lane checkpoints 24/7 is simply the work of a mind out of touch with reality.

its fine to change details to enhance the plot and structure of a story, but there is simply no benefit to this sillyness.

1936,"i hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction. if thoughts are that powerful, they need to be resrained earlier. i don't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive. logic can be quite painful when left alone, but sometimes it has to be

549,"      what is remarkable about this onetime best-selling book -- which could well be described as a coming-of-age-without-coming-of-age novel -- is not that fitzgerald produced it when he was all of 24.  nope, the amazing thing here is that the same writer produced ""the great gatsby"" a mere five years later.  

       ""this side of paradise"" is a mess: it is as uneven, affected, feebly pretentious and relentlessly immature as its hero, the tiresomely self-conscious young minnesotan-gone-to-princeton amory blaine.  (one suspects, in fact, that had fitzgerald abandoned his muddled third-person narrative altogether and rendered the work instead as amory's diary the result would have been considerably more readable -- or the book's structural and methodological flaws considerably more forgivable, at least.)

       that the novel was a roaring success upon publication in 1920 -- it was to prove the most popular book, in terms of sales, ever produced by its author -- presumably speaks to the public's recognition of something new and revealing in it.  okay, amory blaine may well have been the original jazz age prototype; and the drinking and shameless smooching (etc.) that he and his prep school and princeton friends indulge in at various points in the novel were probably, one can accept, a revelation to see in print (and likely a titillating one) for an american audience raised on mcguffy's readers -- and ready for some sort of great departure after the great war.  welp, here it comes:

       ""on the triangle trip amory had come into constant contact with that great current american phenomenon, the `petting party.'
       none of the victorian mothers-and most of the mothers were victorian-had any idea how casually their daughters were accustomed to be kissed.""
 
to the reader at a remove of some 80-plus years this is, of course, very small beer.  what was alarming frankness in 1920 tends to read now, in the best cases of the paradise narrative, as unalarming quaintness. while this is not exactly fitzgerald's ""fault"", so to speak, it is also true that the use of ""shocking revelations"" of this type -- scandals specific to a place and time -- represents a risk a writer takes: the march of history may or may not reveal something lasting and/or universal in such episodes.  in any event, the price the reader pays here, in slogging through the meandering narrative which surrounds amory's adventures in quaintness during the nascent roaring twenties, is very, very high for payoffs of such modest proportions.  i mean, come on: 

""for years afterward when amory thought of eleanor he seemed still to hear the wind sobbing around him and sending little chills into the places beside his heart.  the night when they rode up the slope and watched the cold moon float through the clouds, he lost a further part of him that nothing could restore; and when he lost it he also lost the power of regretting it.  eleanor was, say, the last time evil crept close to amory under the mask of beauty, the last weird mystery that held him with wild fascination and pounded his soul to flakes.""

yikes.  i don't care what new generation you're talking about, can a flake-pounded soul really represent much of an innovation to anybody?  (can it represent anything to anybody?)

       there are things to like, even admire, here and there in paradise.  fitzgerald gets off a few of the wonderfully epigrammatic lines that were to become a trademark (e.g., ""they slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never recovered."" ""sometimes i wish i'd been an englishman; american life is so damned dumb and stupid and healthy."" ""it's better to leave the blustering and tremulo-heroism to the middle classes; they do it so much better."")  and the political incorrectness of some of the narrator's observations is, in its now-curious way, refreshingly, bracingly funny: 

""slowly and inevitably, yet with a sudden surge at the last, while amory talked and dreamed [which is about all amory ever does-mht], war rolled swiftly up the beach and washed the sands where princeton played.  every night the gymnasium echoed as platoon after platoon swept over the floor and shuffled out the basketball markings.  when amory went to washington the next weekend, he caught some of the spirit of crisis which changed to repulsion in the pullman car coming back, for the berths across from him were occupied by stinking aliens-greeks, he guessed, or russians.""

nothing like a little wretched refuse to remind you there's a war on, i always say.  

       anyway, most of the novel consists of young amory's elaborate ponderings -- romantic, philosophical and egotistical -- which are as forgivable as they are forgettable.  i've forgotten them already. at some level, in any case, fitzgerald himself had to recognize the ridiculousness of this pompous character -- who was, of course, a not-very-disguised version of himself.   for how else, if not as commendably self-deprecating irony, are we to take this observation? 

""amory was in full stride, confident, nervous, and jubilant.  scurrying back to minneapolis to see a girl he had known as a child seemed the interesting and romantic thing to do, so without compunction he wired his mother not to expect him, and sat in the train and thought about himself for thirty-six hours.""

       in the end, in any event, one comes back to the initial fitzgerald vs. fitzgerald comparison with something like gaping wonder.  in paradise almost nothing works: form, content, narrative stance, dialogue, character development, pacing -- you name it, it's a problem.  yet in gatsby, five years later, everything works -- everything.  if there is to be a great american novel, it will have to supplant gatsby for the honor.  while it is hard to see how fitzgerald got from point a to point b, the fact is that he did -- and without point a the journey could not have begun. so while ""this side of paradise"" hardly deserves a place in the national literary canon, it surely deserves our respect, and indeed our gratitude, for what it led to.

933,"i was rather disappointed in mr. peterson's work. he dwells much too long on trying to convince us of &quot;the problem&quot;. nearly the first half of the book is spent on statistic overload!  even after wading through the  numbers and graphs, i am still skeptical of his conclusions and would  caution readers to do further research.  certainly the baby boomers are an  aging bulge in the population of the us and will create some challenges.   however, the author fails to mention the &quot;echo boom&quot; (baby  boomer's children which are equal in number) and he glosses over the impact  of the huge young immigration population that comes into the country every  year.  both of these facts will &quot;soften&quot; the impact of the  &quot;gray doom&quot; that mr. peterson tries to create.  i just don't  anticipate the tremendous problem of which  he tries to make us aware.  but  i did find interesting the apparently huge impact that abortions and birth  control will have on our future. another disappointment was very little  discussion of aging trends and buying habits. despite these shortcomings, i  enjoyed parts of the book and it stimulated thinking about the future and  the impact of aging populations

1459,"the late carl sagan was one of the most popular, influential, and successful interpreters of astronomy to the american public. in 1973 he published &quot;the cosmic connection&quot;. he offered a daring view of the universe and his seminal work became a classic of popular science, inspiring a generation of scientists and non-specialist general readers with an enthusiasm for all aspects of science in general, and astronomy in particular. now cambridge university press has reissued a new edition of sagan's influential book, enhanced with freeman dyson's commentary on sagan's vision and on the importance of &quot;the cosmic connection&quot;; ann dryan's assessment of sagan's cultural significance as a champion of science; and david morrison's discussion of the advances made over the past 30 years and what became of sagan's predictions. carl sagan's cosmic connection is &quot;must&quot; reading for all sagan fans and anyone interested in how his views and predictions have held up over the past three decades of rapid advances in the science of astronomy and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence

1664,"companies that embrace work teams quickly discover a basic truth: more teams mean more meetings. management experts laud the benefits of enlightened teamwork, but they spend much less time dwelling on the often long, sometimes pointless and nearly always inefficient meetings that teams breed. with teams fast becoming a fixture in the corporate world, meeting management, or facilitation, is becoming a critical skill for anyone with executive ambitions. author ingrid bens' definition of a facilitator is quite specific - someone who guides a meeting without actually participating in discussion or decision making - but her book is filled with practical advice that any professional can apply when running a meeting. a host of charts, examples and worksheets (not to mention the accompanying cd) help illustrate her process for steering meetings without controlling or directing the outcome. we [...] recommend this hands-on how-to guide to anyone motivated to minimize the waste of meeting-creep

"
1865,"i was eager to read this book only to find it a terrible dissapointment.  one would think that a 'scholar' such as he would have at least a basic understanding of the hebraic roots of judeo-christianity.  
it was obvious that he clearly was clueless to the known messianic signs spoken of in the gospels.  he is also clueless to the pharisidical judaism of the time..not comprehending that all of christ's teachings were completely in keeping with true judaism. all of which can be found in contemporary rabbinical teachings of his time. this book, which some unfortunate readers will swallow as truth will only continue to propagate a backward understanding of the gospels.  
like it or not..the new testament writings are hebraic and explain what fulfilled judaism is.  those who need to divorce judaism from christianity are offering a church which is already confused, just more confusion. it is through studying the hebraic roots that we even begin to understand the 'difficult' sayings of our lord; 'fullfillment of the law', binding and loosing (the law)..etc as well as the parables.  the delivering of the deaf mute..was a messianic sign, because the rabbi's knew that 'they' had to ask the said demon its name but he did not.  lazerus's resurrection was a messianic sign because the rabbi's believed that anyone could come back to life during the first 'three' days after death.  cleansing of a leper was  messainic sign because the rabbi's understood that it was a 'divine' punishment, that only god could lift. how else can we link isa 53 with the 'stripes' he was to received as part of fulfilling the punishment the law required for transgression, and yet 'minus one'. had our lord transgressed the law, then the jews themselves could have legally killed him.  remember paul (saul)?  he also does not understand john and his huge part in the whole picture, in that the kingdom 'began' with john.  he was the 'breachmaker' as fortold in prophecy.  this is hebraic roots 101.  
people, please study the hebraic roots of christianity and do not waste your time with this book. the fact that he keeps defending his position as 'not' anti-semetic, should give you a clue
"
677,"i generally like elmore leonard, this is the twelfth book of his i've read, ranging from his detroit crime capers, to his l.a.-set chili palmer stuff, to some of his westerns. other than the terrible ""be cool"", this is probably my least favorite of his books so far. set in the years between the end of world war i and 1934, the story follows carlos ""carl"" webster from boyhood to manhood as the son of a wealthy pecan farmer rises to became a hotshot u.s. marshall. the story takes place in the dusty midwest, mainly around tulsa and oklahoma city, as carl faces off with various wanna-be desperados seeking to make a name for themselves.

carl is a somewhat vain, cocky lawman, with a keen sense of what kind of quote will get him in the papers. his main foe is the son of a wealthy oil man, a no account young man who has everything he needs, but whose selfish nature and appetite for stirring things up leads him into carl's path. mixed into this are kinds of period details, from prohibition to will rogers shows to klansmen vigilantes to ""true detective"" writers to striking miners to mentions of various real-life bank robbers pretty boy floyd, john dillinger, and bonnie and clyde barrow. 

despite all this background detail, the story itself failed to engage me. there are none of the clever twists and turns that characterize leonard's best work. there's a good guy, a bad guy, and an inextricable outcome whose resolution is surprisingly undramatic. in fact, about halfway through the book i realized that the ""real story"" wasn't going to kick in -- i was in it! and unlike many leonard books, the supporting cast of characters isn't particularly memorable. even leonard's trademark strong dialogue is mostly missing, subsumed by his attempt to stick to period speech. ultimately, one gets the feeling that leonard was most interested in capturing the vibe of the period, and perhaps didn't spend nearly the same amount of effort on the actual story. that said, the depression and its effects are surprisingly absent from the story, given the time and place. all in all, unless you're really really into the whole '30s gangster thing, not worth the time.

"
1553,"yet another historical novel into which a lot of research and work was clearly put, but the result is dissatisfying largely because the author doesn't know how to write.

my single biggest objection to this book is the constant and annoying use of the author's alternative grammatical rules.  comma splices and run-on sentences are not, and never will be, acceptable to me.  occasional use can be overlooked, but shaara peppers every page with them, tacking four or five or more predicates on to the same subject.  the effect is so glaringly obvious that it becomes difficult to continue reading.

the following example is made-up, but it is a good imitation of how shaara writes:

""he turned in the saddle, rode toward his headquarters over the ridge, refused to look back toward the man receding in the distance, focused instead on the day ahead, forced himself to confront the bigger problems at hand.""

one often finds whole paragraphs composed of several run-on sentences in a row like this.  the result is a book that reads like a rough draft, or maybe not even that;  it reads like a collection of notes preparatory to writing a rough draft.  i don't understand how authors get away with publishing such half-finished work, and i don't understand why readers put up with it.

another problem is the lack of convincing characterization.  everyone is vaguely noble here, with the exception of a few complete cads.  washington loves his wife and longs for peace and home.  cornwallis loves his wife and longs for peace and home.  greene loves his wife and longs for peace and home.  i think you get the picture.  few characters stand out on their own.  even lafayette is just another young officer.  the author assumes that we already carry our own perceptions about the major characters and will plug them in at the start of the book.  and shaara's attempts at making his characters witty never work.  the result is a cast of characters that is tedious and dull.

beyond that, i'm doubtful about the author's device of switching focus among the various characters in each chapter.  it's fine when we leap across the atlantic and jump into franklin's mind.  but the rest of the time, it doesn't work well.  i find that i sometimes have to flip back to the start of the chapter to remind myself who has the focus.  either i'm a lazy reader (and i'm not), or the device isn't working well.  in addition, this device constrains the author to keep the narrative focused almost entirely on franklin in france, and washington, green, cornwallis and howe in america.  that means that we get only glimmers of the happenings in parliament and the royal court in england, and the continental congress in america.  in effect, this novel is really about washington's military camp and howe's dinner table, which makes the narrative unbalanced.

some aspects of the story are interesting.  i enjoy reading about washington's maneuvers, and the repeated frustration at coming up with an empty bag and finding that the british have eluded him.  i learned a fair amount about just where the various forces were, and when.  but i wish now that i'd just bought a decent beginner's history on the war.  most of the book, as literary fiction, left me cold

1070,"eoghan casey's text is immediately useful.  it's not theory, it's practical.  it's not biased to one operating system, but covers several technologies.  finally, eoghan and the book's contributors do not gloss over today's most offensive topics, they address them with vigor and solutions.

i would share one concern: the chapter-long product/vendor discussion.  some reviewers label it marketing; other reviewers don't mention it at all.  i'll just forewarn you that you will learn much more about encase or nfr than about their competitors.

as a security consultant for hewlett-packard, it seems my bookshelf fills up entirely too easily, especially as of the last few years.  therefore, i've gotten fairly selective with new book purchases (until i can get a new bookshelf).  however, casey's text is definitely worth getting - worth knocking another book off to make room.  :)

i hope you enjoy this comprehensive text at least half as much as i do

1949,"this book shows in detail how much of the media has gone out of its way to attack the president and how many facts have been distorted in the process.

it also provides a rare look at what the president really does with his time and how much effort he puts into his work.

if you are looking for a book that labels president bush as a liar or a dummy, this is not the book for you.  but it is a superb look at the events of the last year and a half, including the election of 2004.

don't be narrow-minded.  i highly recommend it

1492,"i read a review of this in l.a. weekly which said that it was &quot;a lot  of fun&quot; and entertaining in a sort of ironic way, despite the fact  that it became more slapstick at the end.  i read it, and agreed for the  most part, except i felt that the characters were much stronger and wittier  than i had expected and the author seemed more generous to them than i  would have thought from the initial satirical tone.  the ending was a  little over the top, but it was an example of the kind of senseless  fireworks these characters would have to simulate in their own lives.  all  in all, i thought it was a very intelligent and amusing first novel

665,"when i was in the sixth grade we moved twice, and in all three of the schools from new jersey to connecticut to japan i got to study ancient greece in the history part of the class.  i also got a lot of mileage out of having read edith hamilton's ""mythology"" (i still have my mythology report with my versions of all of the illustrations).  but in all the times i got to study ancient greece before, during, and after the sixth grade i never got to do any of the fun stuff that avery hart & paul mantell come up with for ""ancient greece!: 40 hands-on activities to experience this wondrous age.""  

this kaleidoscope kids volume for kids ages 7-12 not only offers activities but also a variety of information about the ancient greeks.  so this is not simply a book of activities that teachers can pick and choose from to give their students hands-on experiences, it is also a source of facts and stories that will supplement what exists in whatever textbook is being used.  throughout the book there are ""great greeks!"" and things to ""think about.""  after reminding young readers of the gifts that have come down to us from ancient greece, hart and mantell get students acclimated to the idea of looking at the past from the perspective of those who lived way back when.  then the book looks at key periods of greek history.

""meet the minoans: the pre-greeks of crete"" looks at the culture that gave rise to the greatness of greece with activities to make a greek yo-yo, a great mother figure, a hamster labyrinth (without the minotaur), and a fantastic fresco.  that gives you an indication of the sort of activities to be found in this book before we even get to greece itself.  other chapters are devoted to ""the age of heroes,"" where you get a super-short version of ""the iliad"" and can build a trojan horse, ""language unites!"" (including speaking ""pig greek""), ""the dawn of a golden age,"" where you can organize a pentathlon and make a victory wreath, and ""ye gods! greek religion and mythology,"" where you can design your own constellation.

in the last part of the book chapters cover ""classical athens: the flower of ancient civilization,"" where you get to build a greek temple with ionic columns (or even build the entire parthenon), ""think for yourself: philosophy,"" where students can make a monochord or hold a symposium, and ""the amazing arts,"" which covers create sculptures and painting pots in the first part and making masks to make up a greek play in the second part.  the final chapter covers ""a wider world: alexander the great and the hellenistic age,"" where you can start a library.  at the end, students can appreciate how being a greek meant standing in the center of the world (as least, as far as the ancient greeks were concerned).  

again, there are some key issues to be discussed to go along with the activities.  students can debate what is the difference between a hero and a celebrity, understand why every vote counts in a democracy, and decide what makes somebody beautiful.  learning how to press olives or how huge blocks of marble were transported across the sea, gives students an appreciation for how things were different way back when.  throughout the book hart and mantell show how ancient ideas live on in modern traditions, which remains the biggest legacy of the ancient greeks.  

i teach classical greek & roman mythology (not to be confused with modern greek & roman mythology apparently) but i teach it online so i do not really have any opportunities to have my students engage in hands-on activities.  but that does not mean i cannot do them in the privacy of my own home or that elementary school teachers will not find these extremely useful for their unit on ancient greece.  although i am suddenly reminded of coming up with the ""sparthens"" (a.k.a. the warriors with the brains) in elementary school.  but that is another story

"
849,"april of 1865 has been referred to as the month that saved america but april of 1861 may have been just as vital if not more so. it was during this time that washington dc sat completely surrounded by two states that were teetering on the verge of secession. once virginia did leave the union only maryland provided the federal government with a connection to the rest of the nation and it was a tenuous connection at best. 

abraham lincoln was clearly out of his league in this early stage of the game and he leaned heavily on general winfield scott. for his part, scott was keenly aware of the danger facing washington and began to immediately call for any militia units that could get to dc quickly from loyal northern states. the problem was that these militia units would have to travel through maryland, a slave state that might well consider these yankee troops to be invaders and could easily be pushed into the confederacy by such an affront to state sovereignty. it was also distinctly possible that these militia units might be attacked by not only the people of maryland but also ultimately by the state militia.

in the meantime virginia forces had seized the federal armory at harper's ferry and the gosport navy yard near hampton virginia. rumors are rampant in dc that the virginia militia that had taken harper's ferry was preparing to move on washington and many in the federal city were in a state of panic. 

the questions that arise from this drama involve the decision making process on both sides and the ultimate question is of course whether washington dc was ever in any real danger. did the confederacy in fact lose it's only real chance for ultimate victory during this time period? david detzer has done an admirable job in this book of not only bringing this evolving drama to life but also of answering these questions in a clear and concise manner.

this book reads much like a great historical drama and the author's writing style is superbly readable. it is rare for the author of a history book to achieve such a sense of drama since the reader usually already knows the outcome. detzer has accomplished this however and although i was keenly aware of what was about to happen at every turn i had a tough time putting the book down. this invigorating writing style is often derisively referred to as popular history but detzer blows the sides off of that old mold by not only offering new information but also keen observations that cut directly to the heart of this eventful period of american history. no hero of american history is spared criticism when criticism is due and conversely even ben butler is praised when his actions merit it.

this is the story of those fateful days of april and may of 1861 and it is a story that is well told by this supremely able author. this book is well researched, very well written and the story is told from the point of view of both governments as well as the lowliest private in the pennsylvania militia. it is a story upon which the fate of the united states once turned
"
80,"i must agree witht he reviewer who commented about the book being written by committee.   the narrative is choppy and lacking not only key details, but also historical background.   because it's an autobiography, i don't necessarily think that it's fair to damn the book for being self-centered; it is about him.   i do feel, however, that the book needs better editing and a bit more self-examination.   
it's an okay addition to one's list of books about everest expeditions - which i must admit, i've developed a morbid fascination with after recently re-reading ""into thin air"".   i wouldn't, however, use it as my primary source for information or impressions
"
1619,"although i'm not new to wwii histories, the first world war is one of my favorite historical periods to read about and one of my favorite books from that war is alistar horne's ""the price of glory.""  since i enjoyed reading about one if wwi's most epic battles, i did not hesitate to read ""stalingrad: the fateful siege"" by antony beevor.

in both works, comparisons are made between the battles of verdun and stalingrad and for good reasons.  both battles were initiated by german forces that underestimated the tenacity of their enemy, the course of battle spun wildly beyond their commander's control, and both battles cost a near unimaginable loss of life and human suffering.

beevor is especially keen on the amount of human agony throughout the battle of stalingrad, which makes the book gutwrenching but at the same time the reader is unable to put it down.  from the well-documented cold, lice, and hunger that haunted russian and german soldier alike, to the disease and desperation experienced by the sixth army as they were slowly strangled in zhukov's trap, it seems that beevor has overlooked nothing.  unlike many battle histories that may focus on stategy or political fallout of the conflict, the emphasis on human suffering and heroism in beevor's work makes the reader sympathize for russians, germans, romanians, and anyone else unlucky enough to get caught in the battle.

not only does beevor shed light on the plight of ordinary soldiers, he also examines the more famous players in the battle; including a paranoid stalin, a dreaming hitler, a finger-pointing von manstein, and a indecisive paulus.  indeed, the reader gains perspective from rastenburg and moscow all the way down the heirarchy to the frozen bunkers of stalingrad.

overall, ""stalingrad: the fateful siege"" is an excellent book that is recommended for anyone interested in world war ii or just any hard-hitting military history
"
16,"if you like this book you will probably like ""bless the child"" by cathy cash spellman.  they are very similar.  this book can be summed up in one word, simple: simple-minded, simple characters, simple plot (applied loosely), and simple premise.  what a contrived piece of garbage!

i can't describe everything wrong with this book because there's not enough time.  if it's meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through.  if it's meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims, in denial, weak, worried about what everyone thinks, or oblivious.  if it's meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author's plea for that is irritating.  that's how bad this book is! it can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying.

this author has no style.  the book reads like an episode of inside edition.  there is no immersion into the story.  the total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them.  as a reader i felt completely outside the story; an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario.  the attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable.  i've been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn.  the only reason i read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me.  do not waste your time.  

i must say though that this novel was inspirational.  if this crap can make the best seller list, it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published

826,"i'll start with the positive:  the main character is a classic hero in every sense of the word - tall, good-looking, smart, humble, etc.  the story was engaging and made for a quick read because it was easy to follow, carried the reader along and crafted as to have no wasted words.  in short, it was a competent work of fiction. 

that's where my praise ends, because this is the type of work that contributes to our national problems by feeding false stereotypes and radical agendas.  sure, it's a work of fiction, no one is going to take it seriously, yada yada yada.  but that's not true, is it?  so many people in this country believe that this the plot of this book is plausible and even to be encouraged - - just look at the reviews to find the believers.

alright, here are my problems with it:

first, politicians are corrupt and will sell-out anyone to maintain power, but that's not true if you're a conservative farm-boy elected despite your honesty from a midwestern state.  in term limits, vince flynn just beats you over the head with the ""power corrupts"" mantra - he doesn't show it in the actions so much as just repeats it like the chorus of a bad rap song, yet from the lips of the marine combat veteran congressman who is our protagonist.  you know what, though?  there are people in politics on both sides of the aisle who really want to do what's right, who really are trying to make a difference for the positive, for this nation and the citizens.  in this book, however, the public is a tool to be used and treated as if they aren't smart enough to make good decisions.

second, murder is a viable answer.  this repeats another mantra that conservatives repeat often - that they do the hard fighting and living to protect this nation and its freedoms so that the liberals can live in their fantasy-land.  come on, get real.  this book touts a special forces unit as being so committed to the constitution that they are willing to murder high-level politicians and threaten the president with assassination if he doesn't balance the budget.  and, they get away with it because it's really the right side to be on.  murdering our leaders is the answer according to vince flynn.  murder solves the obvious weakness that we have as a nation, that being elections.  elections apparently just get in the way.

third, the balanced budget.  for years and years - until the time this book was written - conservatives cried about the budget.  the book makes it the central theme.  balance the budget and make us fiscally responsible.  it's important enough for a military coup supported by the protagonist of this novel.  a coup!!!  yet, when the conservatives did take power, despite vince flynn's prescient forecasting ability, they ran the deficit into uncharted territory and didn't flinch.  even when confronted by this atrocity of fiscal irresponsibility, they claim that now!!!!! the deficit isn't a big deal, that it's really just a function of the percentage of gdp and we ought to all forget about it.  this book starkly reveals the disconnect between conservative priorities of the 90's and the realized result nearly two presidential terms later.  it's like looking back in time to a parade of nit-wits.

fourth, the good guys don't do bad things.  the special ops team kills only who they want and never any innocents - just the politicians.  the bad guys leave a wake of messy slaughter and civilians whenever they use murder as a tool.  flynn spends way too much time making this point and beating the reader over the head with it . . . killing is good when only your target dies . . . but whatever happened to that oh so famous, though shalt not?

1531,"roger caras, a very talented writer and animal lover, takes us on a tour of thistle hill, his farm in northern maryland.  anyone who loves cats, dogs and other animals will love this book.  its gentle humor and compassion are quite absorbing.  i must confess to a certain amount of jealousy, though--i would love to have a home like thistle hill farm
"
1482,"after anticipating the arrival of this book (that i ordered some time before publication after hearing of it), i was disappointed.  although the subject is timely, the writing style smacks of academia and therefore, will not appeal to the mainstream (reader).  because i'm tenacious by nature, i finished the book, but found my mind wandering throughout because it simply did not hold my attention.  too bad - it could have been inspirational
"
1797,"i really did enjoy reading this book, cover-to-cover. it's very touching and very informative. it will change your ideas about a lot of things. the writer along with other expert contributors have done a great job bringing out all of these real moving stories. i would recommend this book for every human being who cares about other fellow human beings
"
615,"i am a woman and was extremely offended at the portrayel of black men in this book and in the movie.  the work offers no balance whatsoever which feels like a slap in the face.  one black male in this book could have been something other than weak or cruel.  it is no wonder spielberg was eager to take on the project and white people are going to the theater in droves.  the castration of the black male has always been their main attraction, apparently oprah's as well

788,"once again larry mcmurtry delivers the goods in this tale of the old west . we are introduced to calamity jane who spends a lot of time writing letters to her daughter by the light of a campfire. calamity jane joins a western touring company and the sea voyage to america is particularly memorable. there is also another character worth mentioning, namely a native american called no ears who views the world in terms of deep philosophical thought. towards the end of the book we see calamity jane lamenting her lost youth and sadly reflects on the glory days of the old west that she was once a part of. larry mcmurtry has writen a fine novel with a real, believable female character which is something most writers in this genre are unable to accomplish.another wondrous tale from a master of his craft

941,"dr. temperance brennan, a forensic anthropologist, is called upon to aid in the investigation of a commercial jet crash in the mountains of north carolina.  andrew ryan, a colleague and romantic possible, turns up on site also when his partner in the quebec police is listed on the flight manifest.
when temperance discovers a foot that does not seem to come from the disaster site, things begin to get dangerous for her and those around her. it becomes a clue in a deadly mystery involving many highly placed individuals who want their secret to remain just that , a secret.
temperance and ryan spark reactions from each other, the question is, will it ignite or just smolder??
this novel is full of forensic science and detail that open the door to a fascinating yet gruesome world.  
kathy reichs has an afterword page in which she talks about 9/11 and the real disaster site in nyc where she aided in determining the identities of victims from the twin towers, serving on the government disaster response team, much like temperance in this novel.......although she says the horror and emotional impact was more than she could have imagined.  the novel was written and published 2 months before the real disaster occurred
"
1919,"the instruction manual in eq2 is quite addiquate regardless of class. things you are not sure of are learned as you go or you can post on numerous forums for answers.

since there are stats on top of stats and such vast areas with tons and tons of resources and itesm to be had, this book helps you get an idea of the ""where"" and ""what"". as in where you may find x or what y actually does and realated stats. its a reference guide. but as this game is so dynamic, this book has a limited lifspan and as you develop in the world you will find it to be ""old news"" rather quickly
"
424,"this book is poor. it 's not &quot;philosophical&quot; in any sense because it's not logical and it's not supported by the majority of music scholars today. reimer contradicts himself at every turn; he doesn't understand what langer is really saying; and. his absolutist notion of music is completely out of synch with what most scholars argue about music today. reimer just mouths a lot of fluffy, feel-good nonsense

1588,"if you can learn to dance by reading a book whose recommendation was to hold your partner and &quot;move to the music&quot;, then you may find &quot;kaizen event implementation manual&quot; useful. this book talks about the history and terminology of lean manufacturing and does go into detail about team member selection. after that, this book shows blank forms of some of the data analysis forms often used during a kaizen event, but tells you nothing of how to complete the forms and analyze the results. nor is there any &quot;road map&quot; or guidelines for conducting a kaizen event itself. there is information about how to contact the author in the event that you decide to hire him to &quot;fill in all blanks&quot; in person. the book is simply another info-mercial where in this case, you are paying for the advertisement

"
584,"this book has its good points. if anything, it helps you put into words what you want  from a supervisor, but it is not very accurate. the online test does not account for a difference between when 2 of their options are both exactly like you, or if they don't describe you at all. this messes up the results, and it did not describe me very well. i am not just in denial. i have taken a lot of personality type tests, like the keirsey temperment sorter and have a pretty good idea of my strengths. so, although this book is pretty good in making you understand the importance of incouraging your strengths, it still leaves you wondering about how you fit in to their terminology.

as for using this book as a manager to better serve your employees, i'v seen it done and it does not necessarily work because the strengths spit out for people were not wholly accurate. the company i work for has done this, and most of the people who were shifted around to better serve their strengths (according to this book) are very unhappy in their new positions.

your money can be spent better elsewhere. i say its only worth about $10
"
1168,"after reading being peace, i ordered additional copies for all my close friends. this book is both thought-provoking and accessible. thich nhat hanh  has a way of presenting buddhist lessons and ways of being, ways of living and thinking about ourselves and our relationships to others and the world in a style that is almost deceptively simple and deeply thoughtful. i highly recommend this book as either an introduction to buddhist thought or as a way of enriching any life.
"
935,"despite the description and synopsis on the books cover this is not a computer crime novel. in fact with the exception of about 20 pages total the novel quickly looses its snazzy cyber crime appeal. in the first few pages we're introduced to a dark haired female hacker but just as quickly she's gone and the book spirals into japanese gangs, corrupt police, horribly bland and indistinguishable characters, and it just sucks from then on out. the story is good albeit incorrectly marketed. the characters however have no identity! they all sound the same, with the exception of the japanese characters. sadly the book lacks serious writing talent, very little character development, on what could've been a good story. one positive note perhaps is that the descriptions of japanese culture, etc. are really good. perhaps this is due to the authors departure many years before from england to japan. my advice: spend some time abroad again

"
1426,"this is a tough review to write because i felt the authors made a good effort in the writing of the book and explanations of the spring framework. writing a book is no small feat, and technical books are a special beast.

with that last statement in mind, this is were the book sadly falls short. for one, the source code available online is a significant rewrite of the books' code. the authors explain ( on the publisher site ) that this is because they learned better ways and techniques to implement the samlpe application after the book went to print. 

while improvement is always good, this presents two problems. 1. the sample application is now out of sync with the material. not a good thing for those trying to learn, as you require more effort to study in tandem with the book. also, and this is not to disparage the authors skill, but i buy books because i am expecting experienced, if not expert advice. if a small, sample application needs rewriting, perhaps they should write about something else?

further down this road, the sample application has errors that prevent it from compiling. i suspect that the final build file was not tested, or it was a case of ""well, it compiles on my machine"". there were several dependencies that required changes to the build file so it could be compiled. thankfully, i use eclipse and imported the project. eclipse immediately informed me of missing dependencies, which i resolved by getting those jars on the build path and in the build file so they would be deployed in the war archive. examples are:

jakarta-commons/collections, and several core spring jars relating to dao and database access.

for an experienced developer, familiar with ant and a good ide, it was not a lot of trouble to get it running, it just did not give me a good impression.

bonus info for anyone switching the database out to postgresql: first, no matter what db you swap in, you'll need to change a few hard coded references in the build file. i made property variables which i placed in build.properties. then you will need to change the class user to something else ( and of course anything in the app that references it. ). another great reason to use eclipse. 

why you must change it, is user is a reserved keyword in postgresql and you will get databases errors because you can't name a table user
"
727,"alien invasion stories have been done to death since h.g. wells gave us the war of the worlds so it is extraordinarily difficult to come with a new slant to this time-honored genre. well, william c. dietz pulls it off with death day and the concluding volume earth rise. what sets death day apart from most of the invasion tradition is, first of all, the invading force being made up of different races. this makes an interesting dynamic and gives the enemy character as their squabbles, in-fighting and fight for freedom (some are slaves to others) make for something new, different and engaging. also, using racism amonst the aliens as well as the surviving human population rings a true, and tragic, note. the surviving pockets of humanity withdraw within themselves, close off their borders and horde resources. the aliens favor people of color and place them as overseers as human slaves are forced to work building alien temples on earth. and, sadly, collaborators work with the invading force to control the humans. but the seeds of rebellion have been planted. humans and enslaved aliens are fighting back and this first book sets up an alliance between the enslaved races. all this is interesting stuff and makes for a fresh approach. i enjoyed this book and recommend it highly. dietz is the best sf writer working today when it comes to letting character drive the story no matter the setting. 
"
1414,"reinventing the bazaar used real-life examples to make markets understandable to any reader.  from pharmaceutical companies to the tokyo fish market, mcmillan brings markets alive right in front of the readers' eyes.  he attempts to demystify the mystery behind markets, and in my opinion, he succeeds.  each chapter presents a new market setting which mcmillan uses to illustrate his various points.  while the book has an economic undertone, the level of writing is not above the understanding of even a high school student.  all terminology is explained not only with words, but with examples, as well.  the book was enjoyable, especially if you have little familiarity with various market settings.  however, i would encourage anyone to read this book because even the experts on markets will have their knowledge enriched by this book
"
1924,"i have been studing leadership for over 15 years both by reading and experience.  i consider this book to be the best book i have read because it describes leadership as a learned activity.  it also says that leadership is in motivating people to do their own work in solving difficult problems. i found that as president of my congregation i was continually going back to the concepts in the book to lead it through a very difficult situation involving placement of the flags in the sanctuary.  it was very difficult to get people to do their own work and not try to step in to solve everything. (that would have been impossible anyway) i found that he described president lyndon johnson as a successful leader (civil rights) and unsuccessful leader ( vietnam).  his discussion on leading without authority is new ground for me.    if you want to discuss the book with others there is an on-line book study at the work and worship institute website. i found it was a good way for me to get more from the book. this is a great book with great stories of a variety of leaders in our society.

"
1156,"despite the fact that hanegraaff's name is the bigger of the two on the front cover, only the first 40 pages of this very small book are worth reading, and they are the writing of paul maier.  his research is helpful, but so limited in scope that you wonder if he wasn't given a week-end to write it and come up with as much as he could.  every topic needs futher information.  a lot more could be said, and maier seems to be the kind of scholar who could have done a lot more.

hanegraaff contributes 29 pages of defense of the historical jesus which is an even more surface-level reworking of information covered much better elsewhere.

that said, i would give this book to someone who isn't much of a reader but for whom the da vinci code has raised some questions.  it isn't much more than a collection of scattered soundbites, but that may have been a good marketing strategy when there is already such a proliferation of secondary literature on what was only a piece of pulp fiction

462,"this book captures the human spirit, at both its best and its worst.  schwarz-bart is a masterful author in his telling of the tale of ernie levy, from birth and on.  he also, shows us the readers the cruelty of nature that was the nazi movement.  it is unfortunate that so many people had to suffer so much through history as did the jewish people.  it is one might say not a fair trade for normal life to be a just man, although without them humanity would crumble, as future readers will find out their importance.  and if there really are just men in our world...we really owe them a great deal of thanks for taking the pains of the world on their shoulders
"
465,"the best book on the history of world war ii that i've read in a long time. 

the title has three meanings: 

1. it can refer to the gunner at the back of a bomber. the brits called these people 'rear gunners.' the yanks used the term 'tail gunner.' it's the most dangerous position in the plane. 

2. the last plane in the formation. this was more true in the american combat box than in british usage. this position is difficult to hold because it is at the end of a string and every move by the lead ship propagates irregularily through the formation. it is also more dangerous as enemy fighters can attack this ship more easily since there aren't so many guns pointing that direction. 

3. it can refer to the bombing missions near the end of the war. 

this splendid book covers all three of these meanings. in addition it does an excellent job of discussing the power and importance of air power in the defeat of germany

1210,"i can't give this book more than two stars, and that's being generous. 

mr. hall does present some interesting ideas, but unfortunately, his editors have done him a huge disservice. here are the first three sentences of stage i, on page 23; 

essentially what we have now--nanoscale science and technology--including the ability to image at the atomic scale with scanning probe microscopes, and a very limited ability to manipulate, that is, by pushing things around with the same scanning probes. a scanning probe is essentially like feeling something with a stick. because you have a computer behind it, you can touch it in a very close grid of points and produce a picture.

i made it through the first fifty pages, and it didn't get any better.  

i don't know if mr. hall had a final read before publication, or not, but someone should have stopped this book from being published until it was properly edited.

23,"``people  say again and again that philosophy  doesn't really progress, that we  arestill occupied  with the same philosophical problems as were  thegreeks.but  the people who say this don't understand why ishas to be  so. it is becauseour language has remained the same and  keeps seducing us  into asking the same questions.  as longas there continues to be a verb  'to be' that  looks as if it functions in the same way as 'to eat' and  'to  drink', as long as we stillhavethe adjectives  'identical', 'true',  'false', 'possible',as  long as we continueto talk of a river of time, of  an expanseof  space, etc., etc., people will keepstumbling over the  samepuzzling  difficulties and find themselves staring atsomethingwhich  no explanation seems capable of clearing up.and what'smore,this  satisfies  a longing for the transcendent, because, insofar  as peoplethinkthey can  see `the limits of human  understanding', theybelieve of course thatthey  can see  beyond these.`` 

''philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of ourintelligence by means of language``

``ambition is the death of  thought'''

these three quotes are from ludwig wittgenstein who redefined philosophysome70 years ago (but most people have yet to find this out).dennett, though he has  been a philosopher for some40 years, is one them. it is also curious that both he and his prime antagonist, john searle, studied under famous wittgensteinians (searle with john austin, dennett with gilbert ryle) but searle got the point and dennett did not. dennett is a hard determinist(though he trys to sneak  reality in the back door), and perhaps this is due to ryle, whose famous book 'the concept of mind'(1949) continues to be reprinted.  that book did a great job of exorcising the ghost but it left the machine.  dennett enjoys  making  the mistakes wittgenstein, ryle(andmany others since) have exposed in detail. 

byaccident,just before this book, i had  read ''the minds i'', which dennett coauthored withdouglas hofstadter in 1981. they made some bad  mistakes(see my review), and saddest of all, they reprinted  twofamous articles that pointed the wayout of the mess---nagel's `what is  like to be a bat?` and an early version of john  searle's chinese room argument explaining why computers  don't think.

 nagel pointed out that we do noteven know how to recognize whata concept of a bat's mind would be  like.  searle similarly explained how we lack a way to conceptualize  thinking  and how itdiffersfrom what a computer does(eg,it can translate chinese  without understanding it). likewise, we lack a clear test for recognizing  what countsas good  vs bad--or just intelligible-- for many philosophical and scientific concepts. our  use of the words consciousness, choice, freedom, intention,  particle, thinking, determines, wave,cause, happened,  event(and so on endlessly) are  rarely a source of confusion  but as soon as we leave normal life and enter philosophy(and anydiscussion detached from the environment  in  which language evolved) chaos reigns. wittgenstein  was the first to understand why and to point out how to avoid  this. unfortunately, he died inhis prime, his works are composed almost entirely of a series of examples of  how the mind(language)  worksand he never wroteany popular books,  so  understanding of his work is restricted to a very few. 

searle  is one of the world's leadingphilosophers and has written  manyextremely clear  and highly regarded articles and books,some of which have pointed out the  glaring defects in dennett'swork.his review ``consciousness explained  away'' of dennetts 1991 book`'consciousness explained'' and his book''the mystery of consciousness'' are very well  known,and show, in a way that isamazingly clear for philosophical writing,why neither dennett(nor any of the  hundreds of philosophersandscientists who have written on this topic)havecome closetoexplaining the hard problem--ie, how do you conceptualizeconsciousness.many suspect we will never be able to conceptualizeany of the reallyimportant things, but it isclear that we are  nowhere near it now. dennett has mostly  ignored his critics but has favored  searle with vituperative personal attacks.searle has been accused by dennett and others of  being out to destroy cognitive psychology which is quite funny as modern philosophy is(mostly) a branch of cognitive psychology and searle has made it very clear for 30 years that we are a good example of a biological machine that is conscious, thinks, etc,.  he just points out that we don't have any idea how this happens.   searle characterizes as ''intellectualpathology'',the views ofdennett andall those who denythe existence of thevery phenomena they setout to explain. dennett repeats his  mistakes here andleaves his reply to his critics to the penultimate page of  the book, where we are told that they areall mistaken and it is a waste of spaceto show how! unsurprisingly, there isnot one reference towittgenstein or searle in theentire book.there arehowever, many references to other old schoolphilosophers who are as confusedas he is. 

like most people, it does not cross his mindthatthe very inference engineshe thinks with are forcinghim to cometo  certainconclusions and that these will oftenbe quite  unconnectedwith or wrong about the way things are in the  world. they are a jumble of evolutionary curiositieswhich do various tasks in organizing behavior that were useful for survivalhundreds of thousands of years ago.wittgenstein was a pioneerin doingthought experiments in cognitive psychologyand beganto elucidate the nature of these engines and the subtletiesof language in the 30's, and thus he made the sorts of commentsthat this review begins with. 
dennett says(p98)that  his view is compatibilism, ie, that  free will(whichi hopewe can equate with choice) is compatible with  determinism(ie, that''there is at any instant exactly one physically  possible  future''--p25). he wants to show that determinism is not the same as inevitablity. however, the whole book is smoke  and mirrors by means of  which choice, in the sense we normally  understand it, disappears and we are  left with ``choice``,  which is something we cannot choose. naturally, this  echoes  the fate of consiousness in his earlier book ``consciousness  explained``. 

it is remarkable that, at a time when we are  just beginning to  reach the point where we might be able to understand the basics of how a  single neuron works(or how an  atom works for that matter), that anyone should  think they can  make the leap to understanding the whole brain and to explain  its most complex phenomena. please recall the last sentence of wittgenstein  from the opening quote: ''and what'smore,this satisfies a longing for thetranscendent, because, insofar aspeoplethinkthey can see `the limits of  human understanding',theybelieve of course thatthey can see beyond  these.`` the  relation between language, thought and reality is  extraordinarily complex and everyone gets lost. if one is very, very  careful,some understanding is possible, but dennett throws caution to  the  winds and we are dragged into the quicksand. 

there are  at least 3 different  topics here(evolution of our brain, choice  and morality) and dennett tries  vainly to weld them together into  a coherent account of how freedom evolves  from the deterministic  crashing of atoms. there is, however, no compelling  reason to  accept that bouncing atoms (or his favorite example, the game  of  life running on a computer) are isomorphic with reality.  he knows that  quantum indeterminacy(or the uncertainty principle)  is a major obstacle to  determinism however defined(and has  been taken by many as an escape to  freedom) but dismisses  it due to the fact that such events are too rare to  bother  with. by extension, its unlikely that any such  event will happen now or even in our  whole lifetime in our  brain, so we appear to be stuck with a determined  brain(whatever  that may be). however, the universe is a big place and its been  around a long time(perhaps forever) and if even one such quantum  effect occurs  it would seem to throw the whole universe into  an indeterminate state. the  notion ''there is at any  instant exactly one physically possible future''  cannot be true  if at any instant a quantum indeterminacy can occur--in this  case  there would seem to be infinitely many possible futures. this  recalls  one of the escapes from the contradictions of physics--each  instant our  universe is branching into infinitely many universes. 

he correctly rejects the idea that quantum indeterminacy gives us the answer to how we can have choice.  this obvious idea has been suggested by many but the problem is that nobody has any idea how to specify an exact sequence of steps which starts with the equations of physics and ends up with the phenomena of consciousness(or any other emergent phenomenon).  if so, they will definitely win at least one nobel prize, for not only will they have explained consciousness, they will have explained the universal phenomenon of emergence(how higher order properties emerge from lower ones). so, they would have to solve the 'easy' problem(to determine the exact state of the brain corresponding to some mental state and preferably specify the exact position of all the atoms in the brain over time-ignoring uncertainty) and the 'hard' one(what exactly correlates with or produces consciousness or choice etc?). and while they are at it how about also doing the  impossible--an exact and full solution to the quantum field equations for a brain.  it is very well known that these equations are uncomputable, even for one atom or a vacuum, as it would require an infinite amount of computer time.  but infinite will do for one atom so maybe a brain will take no longer. 

he starts off on the  first page appealing to the laws of  physics for protection against fantastic  notions such as immaterial souls, but physics is made of notions just as  fantastic(uncertainty,  entanglement, wave/particle duality, schrodinger's  dead/alivecat etc) and as feynmann said many times ``nobody understandsphysics!'' many think nobody ever will. 

on pg  2 he says  our values have little to do with the goals of our cells and  on pg 2  to3 that our personality differences are due to how  our ''robotic teams are  put togther, over a lifetime of  growth and experience.`` this is a bald  dismissal of human  nature, of the abundant evidence that our differences are  to  a large extent programmed into our genes and fixed in early  childhood, and  is typical of his constant confused wandering  back and forth between  determinism and environmentalism.

on page  9 he notes that free will is a problem and our  attitudes to  it make a difference, but for whom? nobody but philosophers. we make choices. what's the problem?  one has to step  outside life to experience a problem and then  everything becomes a problem.  what are consciousness, pain,  yellow, intention, matter, quarks, gravity  etc.? i doubt that  anyone has ever experienced a fundamental change in their  interactions  with people or their decision making processes due to their  thinking about choice. this shows that there is something  strange about such questions. wittgenstein would probably say that the language games are  different. there are games  for language connected with the cognitive  templates for decisions  or seeing colors etc, and thinking philosophically is operating them in decoupled mode. decoupled modes permit  thinking about the past, planning for the future, guessing  the mental states  of others, etc, but if one takes the results  in the wrong way and starts to  think `'john will try to steal  my wallet'', rather than just imagining that  john might  do it, confusion enters and those who cannot turn off the decoupled  mode or distinguish it from coupled mode,  enter the realm of pathology. some aspects of schizophrenia and other mental illness might be  seen this way--they lose control of which mode they are in, eg, notbeing able to see the  difference between the motives people  have and the motives they might have. 

one can then see  much of the philosophizing people do as operating in  these  decoupled modes but failing to be able to keep in front of them  the  differences from the normal mode. normal mode--eg, what  is that lion doing--  was undoubtedly the first one evolved  and decoupled modes--what did that lion  do last time or what  does he intend to do next--evolved later. this was  probably  never a problem for animals--any animal that spent too much  time  worrying about what might happen would not be very successful  contributing to  the gene pool. it is interesting to speculate that only when humans developed  culture and began degeneratinggenetically, could large numbers of people  survive with genes that  led them to spend alot of time in decoupled modes.  hence, we  have philosophy and this book, which is mostly about running the  decision templates in decoupled mode where there are no real  consequencesexcept earning royalties for putting the results  in a book for other people to  use to run their engines in decoupled mode.' let us alter wittgenstein's quote to read:  ''as longas there continues to be a verb 'to decide'  that looks as if it functions in the same way as 'to  eat' and 'to  drink',as long as we continueto talk of  freedom of action, of saying i  wish i had done otherwise,  etc., etc., people will keepstumbling over the  samepuzzling  difficulties andfind themselves staring atsomethingwhich  no  explanation seems capable of clearing up.''

as withmost philosophy books, nearly every page, often every paragraph,  changes from one type of language  game to another without  noticing that now one would have to be joking or  dreaming  or acting in a play or reciting a story , etc, and not actually  intending anything nor describing an actual situation in the  world. on page  10 he says we count on free will for the  whole way of thinking about our lives,  like we count on food  and water, but who ever, outside philosophy, standing in  front  of lunch counter full of food, ever thinks how fine it is that  they  have free will so they can pick coke instead of mineral  water? even if i  want to be a serious compatibilist and  try thinking this in decoupled mode, i  have to exit and  enter nondecoupled mode to make the actual choice. only then  can i go back to decoupled mode to wonder what might have  happened if i had  not had the ability to make a real choice.  wittgenstein noted how pretend  games are parasitic on real ones(this is not a trivial observation!).  the ability to engage in very complex  decoupled scenarios  is already evident in 4 year old children. so i would say  that normally, nobody counts on having choice, but rather we just choose. 


on the same page he shows again that he does not grasp cognitive  basics.  he says we learn to conduct our lives in the conceptual  atmosphere of choice,  and that `'it appears to be a stable  and ahistorical construct, as eternal  and unchanging as arithmetic,  but it is not.'' and on page 13--''it is an  evolved creation  of human activity and beliefs''. the whole thrust of  cognitive  psychology is that we do not learn the basics of planning, deciding,  promising, resenting, etc, but that these are built-in functions  of the  inference engines that work automatically and unconsciously  and start running  in very early childhood. there is no evidence  that they change as we grow,  or are in any way subject to  our beliefs,only  that they mature just as our body does. 

on pg 14 he suggests  its probable that our having free will depends on our believing  we have  it!  do we believe we see an apple, feel a pain, are  happy? the language  game of belief is very different from  that of knowing. we can believe we have  a dollar in our  pocket but if we take it out and look at it we can't  meaningfully  then say that we still believe it(except as a joke etc.). the  inference engine can run in decoupled(belief) mode so we can  imagine havingchoices or making them, but in life we just make them and it is only in very  odd situations we can say  that we believe we made a choice. but dennett is  saying thisis the universal case. if making a choice had any dependence on belief than so would everything everything else--consciousness,  seeing,  thinking,etc. if we take this seriously(and he says 'the serious problems of  free will' ) then we are getting  into trouble and if we actually try to apply  it to life, then madness is minutes away. 
. 
on page 65 et seq., he  discusses causation, intention and the `informal predicates'  that we use to  describe atoms etc, but cognitive resarch has  shown that we describe all  objects with a limited number of  ontological categories which we analyse with  our intuitive physics  modules and that when agents (ie animals or people or  things  like them--ie, ghosts or gods) are involved we use our  concepts (engines)  for agency, intuitive psychology, social minds, etc to  decide  how to behave. there is almost certainly no causation module  but  rather it will involve all of these and other inference  engines, depending on  the precise situation. discussing  possibility and necessity is much  easier if  one talks in terms of the output of our modules for intuitive  physics,  agency, ontological categories etc. of course there is no mention  here of wittgenstein's many incisive comments on causation,  intention,  deciding, nor of searle's now classic works  on intention and social reality. 

he spends much time on  ainslie's book 'breakdown of will', in which is  discussed  the hyperbolic discounting faculties (ie, inference engines) by which  we evaluate probable outcomes.
hemakes much of the excellent work of robert frank on altruism, emotion and economics, but the book he cites was 15 years old when this book was published. it was bingham's idea, amplified by frank and by boyd and richardson (1992) that  cooperation  was greatly stimulated by the evolution of means for punishing cheaters. he suggests these as examples of darwinian approaches  that areobligatory and promising. indeed they are, and  in fact they are standard  parts of economic, evolutionary  and cognitive theory, but unfortunately, he  makes little reference  to the other work in these fields. all that work tends to show that people do not choose but their brains choose for them. he does not establish any convincing connection between this work and the general problem of choice. 

onpg 216 he says that making oneself so  that one could not have  done otherwise is a key innovation in  the evolutionary ascent to free will,  and that we can only  be free if we learn how to render ourselves insensitive  to  opportunities. but where this ability resides is not revealed  for  several chapters! dennett has a penchant for hiding  his ideas in a massive  amount of rather irrelevant text.  again, he gets things backwards, as there is  a vast body of  very good evidence from biology and psychology that we are get  the feelings that we should behave in some way from our inference engines and  these are not provided by some part of our conscious  self, but by the automatic and unconscious operation of the  engines. as he notes, hundreds of experiments  with the prisoner's dilemma  and related protocols have shown how easy it is to  manipulate  people's choices and that their calculations are not conscious  and  deliberate at all. when the situation is manipulated to  make them conscious,they are much slower and  less reliable. so, there has been  constant pressure of natural  selection to make the engines fast and automatic  and inacessible  to deliberate thought.

dennett says `we make ourselves'  so  that we could not do otherwise and that this is the basis  of morality and  choice. the evidence would seem to be exactly  the opposite. our inference engines give  us basic moral intuitions and  we generally act in accord with the results.  if we or others  do not we feel guilt, outrage, resentment etc, then cheater genes will invade the population and this is one of the main theories as to how a good part of morality evolved.our genes make us so we can't(mostly) do otherwise, not our will or whatever dennett thinks can do it.   we can often choose to do otherwise but our own  intuitions and the knowledge of social disapproval  usually serve to limit our choices. these intuitions evolved  in small groups between 50,000 and some  millions of years ago. in the modern world the intuitions are often not to  our  advantage and the social controls weak. this is a prime reasonfor the chaos in the world.

on pg  225 he finally sneaks in a definition of free will  as ''a complicated snarl of mechanistic causes that look likedecision making(from certain angles)''. he claims that thisplays all the valuable  roles of free will but lacks some  (unspecified) properties possessed by  traditional free will.  the smoke is thick but i  am pretty  sure one of those unspecified properties is what we understand aschoice. he insists(top pg 226) that his naturalistic  account of decision  making leaves plenty of room for moral  responsibility, but making ourselves so  we couldn't do otherwise  does not seem to describe the way we actually  function, nor  does it seem to leave any room for morality, as that would seem  to consist precisely in being able to do otherwise. 

he  does not propose  any test for deciding if a choice is voluntary  or forced and i doubt he could  do so. normally if someone  asks us to move our hand, we know what counts as  having a  choice, but, typical of philosophers, i expect that regardless  of  whether it moves or not he will count both as evidence for his position. 

at this point he also starts his discussion of libet's well known work on conscious attention which is the only part of the book that i felt was worth my time. 

on page 253 et seq., he sneaks in his definition of conscious will--the  ''brains user illusion  of itself''' which has as one of its main roles  providing  ''me with the means of interfacing with myself at other times``.  and ``illusory or not, conscious will is the persons guide  to his or her own  moral responsibility for action.`` he says  the trick we need is to see that  ``i`' control what is happening  inside the ''simplification barrier''...  ''where decision  making happens''. ``mental events'' become conscious by  ''entering  into memory''. ''the process of self description... is  what we  are''. the crucial thing is that choice is possible  because the self is  distributed over space(the brain) and time(memories).  he realizes this is  going to leave many incredulous(everyone who can follow this and really understands!). ''i know that many  people find it hard to graspthis idea or take it seriously. it seems to them  to be a trickwith mirrors, some kind of verbal slight of hand that whisksconsciousness, and the real self , out of the picture just when it was about to  be introduced.'' many will say he took the words out of their mouth, but i would  say it's incoherent and  thateverythingwe know about consciousness and the whole  universe(making the obvious extensions of such claims)  was gone long beforewegot this far. 


on pg 259 he says that culture has made us rational animals!  this is a stunning denial of human nature(ie, genetics and evolution) coming from the person who wrote 'darwin's dangerous idea''!  presumably he is talking about his idea that it is memories spread over space(the brain and other people) and time that give us choices and morals and consciousness(line 6 from bottom).  he says consciousness is a user-interface but it is never made clear who or where the user is and how it interfaces with the brain(you will have to suffer through 'consciousness explained to find that there is no answer there either).  though he makes many references to evolutionary and cognitive psychology, he seldom uses any of the terminology that has been current for decades(social mind, intuitive psychology, coalitional intuitions etc) and clearly is not familiar with most of the concepts. if he means that we got the fine details of morality from culture, thats ok, but this is the icing on the cake and the cake was baked by the genes.  

we are also told here that r&d(by which he means evolution here, but other things elsewhere) has given us the self  and that language creates new kind of consciousness and morality.  i am sure that he will get little agreement on this.  it seems quite clear that consciousness and the basics of morality evolved in primates(and earlier) long before spoken language(though it is a very deep topic as to how language evolved from extant capacities in the brain).  he continues ``morality memes arose by accident some tens of thousands of years ago`` which would be ok if he meant the icing on the cake but he clearly means the cake!  and then he says the point of morality is not the survival of our genes, which is an amazing (and totally incorrect)thing to say, even if he was only referring to memes.  
on pg 260 he claims  that  because we do not comprehend our ''bland dispositions  to cooperate'', they  mean nothing to us, but it is the operation  of our templates that is  everything to us. there is ample  evidence that if one of them is damaged a  person cannot function  properly as a social being(eg, autism).  i would say it is the operation of the templates for intuitive psychology etc which lead dennett to the counterintuitive views that we do not have consciousness and choice in the way we think.  

he also says here that it was one of the major  evolutionary transitions when we were able to change our views and reflect on reasons for them. this again reflects his lack of understanding of evolutionary psychology.  i know of no evidence that the basic moral intuitions, like all the templates, are accessible to consciousness.  we may decide our cheating was justifiable, or forgive someone else's cheating, but we still know it was cheating(ie, we cannot change the engine). i suspect my ancestors a million years ago had the same feelings in the same situation but what has happened is that there are lots of other things that may be taken as relevant and that sometimes these will lead me to act contrary to my feelings.  another issue is that as culture developed, one had to make many important or 'moral type` decisions for which the engines were not evolved to give a clear answer.  

on pg 267 he says that we now replace our `free floating rationales'(probably corresponding to what cognitive psychologists call our templates or inference engines) with reflection and mutual persuasion. and on pg 286 he says that it is a child's upbringing --demanding and giving reasons-- that affects moral reasoning. again, he just has no grasp of what has happened in the last 30 years of research--the templates do not change with reflection or upbringing. we are then told again that consciousness makes moral issues available over time to the self, which takes responsibility.  it is not any more coherent or credible with repetition.  

on pg 289 he has a chapter summary which repeats the mistaken notions that it is culture that makes it possible to reflect and that choice depends on education(memory) and sharing.  it's clear that it is not culture but the inherited cognitive structures that make it possible to reflect and to choose and that culture determines the acceptable actions and their rewards or punishments. on pg 303 he discusses the classic philosophical barrier between 'ought'and 'is' , unaware that our templates solved that problem long ago--ie, they tell us how to feel about situations regarding other people.  he also seems to be unaware that there are hundreds of cultural universals implanted in our genes(eg see 'the blank slate'). 

he often starts into what looks like its going to be a good discussion of some issue in evolutionary psychology, but invariably wanders off into philosophical arcana and winds up with more confusion.  this happens on pg 261 where he states that concepts like 'praiseworthy' were shaped over millennia by culture, while most would say the basis for such concepts is in the genes and each culture only detetermines the details of acceptable reactions to the intuitions its members get from their innate mechanisms.   on pg 262 he tries to explain how an ess(evolutionarily stable strategy) can produce morality. his idea here is that genetic `r&d` produces dim understandings of morals and then culture(memetics) produces variations and clarifications.  i would say that we all know, and much research has made clear, that we commonly get very clear results from our inference engines and only dimly understand in special cases.  culture merely decides what we can do about our feelings.  

the last part of the book is mostly  concerned  with moral culpability. he refers to the legal classic by hart  and  honore, which i started reading 30 years ago since it's  authors were deeply influenced by wittgenstein.  dennett tells us that we have  control over our own morality and  that thinking about morality will improve us.  but, there seems  no justification whatever for this view in this book. there is nothing at  all  here to help anyone escape from the dictates of the monkey mind. it is a defensible point of view that those who manage this do so by traveling a spiritual path that  has no connection with philosophy- and there is not a hint of  spirituality in this entire book--another telling point considering that many mystics have fascinating things to say about the functioning of the mind. i find  more wisdom about how  to be free and moral in any of osho's 200 books than anywhere in philosophy. one rarely finds spiritually and morally  advanced people teaching at universities. there is no sign here, nor in  anything he has done, that dennett is morally superior. after 40 years of thinking about morality he launches personal attacks on his critics or arrogantly dismisses them.  it seems clear that, like all of us, he is trapped in the limits of his inference engines. 

so, how much opportunity is there to  improve our morality? it seems  clear(eg, see pinker's `the blank slate`) that  most of our behaviour  is genetic and the rest due to unknown factors in our  environment, in spite of the vigorous efforts of parents and religions and political parties. on  average, maybe 5% of the variation in moral behavior(variations are the only thing we can  study) is due to our own efforts. the moral choices that matter  most today are  those affecting the fate of the world. but our moral templates were not evolved to deal with overpopulation and the greenhouse effect. 

how remarkable it would be if just one of the hundreds of millions of educated people in the world managed to figure out what consiousness or choice or any mental phenomenon really is.  and if one did, we would expect them to be a scientist at the cutting edge of research using some exotic fmri  equipment and the latest parallel processing neural networked fuzzy logic computer etc.  but a philosopher or physicist just sitting there thinking, coming up with the solution to the greatest puzzle there is!  and then writing a whole book about it without checking with the sceptics first.  to return to the quote at the beginning--'ambition is the death of thought'.  indeed--though clearly wittgenstein was thinking of interesting thoughts
"
565,"in his last command, gaunt's ghosts have returned from their mission on gereon, a chaos controlled planet, to ancreon sextus where war is also raging, in a continuation of the story of gaunt's ghosts. they have been changed which is frightening to those around them. they changed in order to survive on gereon, but others think the transformation may be more sinister; therefore, they are put in internment camps and questioned. 

finally, they are allowed back into battle as the forces attack sparshad mons, a step-city ruin on ancreon sextus, which appears to be filled with the enemy. not many people want to listen to gaunt, even though he is an expert warrior with sharpened senses. nothing is as it seems as the battle progresses and gaunt must find a way to get his superiors to understand what he knows. will gaunt ever convince them that what they are seeing is not really what they are seeing?

dan abnett has written a sequel to a story that i think you would need to read before tackling this one. after a spell, things did become clearer and i was able to pick up the storyline. the characters were well flesh out and the writing was smooth but the story did move a bit slow in places when some of the battles were taking place.  there were many battles and a lot of dying on the battlefields. strange monsters inhabited the land and only gaunt knew where they came from. the monsters were fascinating in that they could not be killed in a normal way. only gaunt's ghosts knew how to get rid of them.

1496,"easily the worst textbook i encountered during my undergraduate years.  unfocused, sparse, and almost completely lacking example problems.  riggs touches briefly on lots of topics and treats none of them completely, leaving the reader lacking any notion of how process control actually works in real life.  i'm not a big fan of the book by seborg et al. either, but if you have to choose between the two, go with seborg
"
857,"i read this book several months ago, and i still can't shake the feeling of having read a very, very good book. the effect of yourcenar's words still lingers.

the text is an imagined valedictory letter or speech from emperor hadrian to his successor. the emperor himself is dying, and faces a world that he is about to leave behind. he recalls his life, from being a young boy in his native spain, to his ascension to the highest public post imaginable, that of emperor of rome. just as his professional career was incredible, so is the generosity and candidness of his ""confession"". there is seemingly no secret nook left untouched from his personal life. 

in the end, having cast that final weight, his conscience, from off his shoulders, the emperor is at last able to turn away from one world and face another - that of the gods.

1532,"williams's ear for dialogue, his eye for character, his exploration of love, longing and loneliness are as powerful in these short stories as they are in his plays.  on occasion, the glimmer of a future work rises out of the text, such as the line, ""but the sweet bird of youth had flown from pablo gonzales...""

1055,"i got this as both a book and an audio file.  i had waited to read it and was surprised by both the enthusiasm of the content and its author, but also by how he snuck in some odd biblically unsound thoughts (e.g., i gasped when he suggested christ went to hell...what bible passage evidences this?).

i agree with how he suggests the enemy is out to deceive us and keep us asleep...but wonder if i go further how much more eldredge will slip in of his own peculiar biblical misintrepretations.  where were his editors when this was being written?  why take sensible good sections and mar them with oddities?

i havent read all the reviews here but as one of those ""conservatives"" frequently mentioned in them i have to admit i may not even finish this book for fear of what else eldredge has slipped up on.

i did appreciate his story about daniel and the ""delayed"" angel...but am left wondering if i need go deeper into researching that as possible misintepretation too.

what a shame this book is turning into such a questionable venture for me.  we are at war as the author suggests and we must guard the source material well..the bible well.  so far...i may join others and ditch this valiant attempt to energize christians and return to the word itself.

i wonder if i can get a refund

785,"on page 116, formula 6.1, the price formula for a bond is actually for a semiannual coupon bond, not as stated on the book, for annual coupon bond.
as a consequence, the dv01, duration and convexity formula it states are for semiannual coupon bonds as well.

1948,"i first heard this story as a part of a sermon given to a congregation of mixed ages.  the children were enthralled with the illustrations (as were many adults) but the &quot;message&quot; was deeply felt by the &quot;older&quot; child in all of us there.  it is the message that no one really knows how much influence they have.  mole was just doing something that really intrigued and interested him, and brought him pleasure.  he wished that he could influence others, but never knew what his music did for the world.  maybe this is true for each of us as we pursue what we really have a passion for.  the message is true for children and adults alike. i will share this with my young 8 year old violinist friend, and from the pulpit. thank you, david mcphail

1909,"the story is both true and extremely unique: the author, who is an austrian mountaineer and a ss nazi officer at the same time,  escapes from a british pow camp in india with the goal to go through tibet to japan-occupied burma, to be sent back to germany, so as not to miss his chance to participate in wwii.  the extreme difficulties of hiding from officials and surviving the wintry elements of the himalaya mountains make his burma plan impossible, so he stays in tibet.  his unthinkable achievements include storming his way into the ""forbidden city"" (lhassa, the capital), gaining employment in the tibetian government, becoming a friend of the ""god-king"" dalai lama - an extremely bright, knowledge-hungry teenager, and learning the tibetian language to the degree which anable him to do live interpretation for dalai lana of english-language movies (""believe me, it is not easy for a german to translate shakespearian english into tibetian""). 
going with a yak through the snows of the 20,000-feet himalayan passes, escaping merciless robbers, manouvering between border guards - make seven years in tibet a great adventure book. however, the insightful and rich observations about tibetian people, customs, culture and politics, go far beyond  any other available information on that far-away country, and dalai-lama's foreword to this book confirms this fact.
the peaceful and friendly life and culture of tibet is raped by military annexation of tibet by china in 1951. the ancient monasteries are destroyed, the puritan-like culture is replaced by such crude elements of civilization as e.g. brothels for the occupying soldiers,  dalai lama twice escapes to india, and so does the author; one third of the tibetians die of starvation.
""seven tears ib tibet"" allows us a bitter-seet inside into see a country, that lived the way how countries in medieval times lived; also, the country trampled and largely destroyed by its aggressive neighbour.

521,"tony nourmand's &quot;film posters of the 60's&quot; is a wonderful and  colorful coffee table style book that is a great treat to look through.  there are many of the classic film poster images of the french new wave,  the films of stanley kubrick and the classic 007 posters, just to name a  few. film poster collecting is a great adventure and this book reflects  that enthusiasm. this book was lovingly organized with great detail. a  superb value! looking forward to future editions

193,"not many writers can characterize children realistically. somehow a stylized silhouette emerges and the child fades in the background and the plot or adult characters take over the storyline and the children characters end up being nothing more than fluff. this is definately not one of those novels. carson mccullers writes almost with artistic persicion on her two most elaborate characters, f. jasmine and john henry west. i really cannot think of another story, maybe, a good man is hard to find, by flannery o'conner, where the writer can get inside the mind of a child; evoking their unique thoughts and feelings with a sense of ease. john henry west is one of the most well rounded and well written children i have ever read, and that is a great homage to her writing ability. 

*i first read this at ten, can see that age or older reading it. will have a intense impact on a sensitive pre teen reader

1227,"i haven't completed the book yet, but so far have found it to be very insightful and enjoyable.  it begins in genesis and continues from there hitting on the most commonly read bible sections to the not so often or  seldom read sections.  he ends everyday with a thought provoking question  to think on through out the rest of your day. i always look for to the next  reading

861,"as a student of urban development and politics, i can confidently say that this book is a forgettable work of a parochial mind. davis offers a hardline marxist view of los angeles that, by employing simply economic analysis, does not allow for the intricacies of the city's problems. class warfare plays a much smaller role in the sprawl of los angeles -- anyone outside of the iso should be discouraged from reading this baseless drivel
"
1138,"a singularly dull book, the characterizations seemed flat and the peg on which the novel is hung, a south victorious with modern weapons, seemed too trivial.  the author has to make something compelling in that conceit or for the reader the book will mean nothing.  unfortunately there seems little real purpose to the idea unless one finds the characterizations of historical figures believable and they are not.  the character of robert e. lee in the book is just too, too good to be sympathetic or even credible and the stock characters that pop up to lend support seem like cardboard cutouts.  i finally felt that the book was going in such an obvious direction that i put it down halfway through.  i am not sure if it turns out the way i think but frankly there was nothing in the first half of the book to make me care one way or the other
"
692,"melrose larry green's book is full of quotes.  quotes and information used to back up points are good things.  he appears to have researched by surfing the internet, watching television and legally incorporating the opinions of others.  this is all fine and acceptable.

the problem with ""why the clintons belong in prison"" is when the author (cut and paste expert) attempts his own narrative, which is sporadic, jumpy and poorly edited.  his points are not linear, and show the author's attention deficit.  with a proper literary team, this book could have been something of note but unfortunately it feels like a ""hit and run"" report and reads like a one-sided sensationalized talk radio program.  
"
333,"""the case for faith"" is the weakest volume in a strong series. 

strobel's format is fun and engaging. i find his books as ""un-put-downable"" as any blockbuster page-turner. 

strobel holds a degree from yale law school, and he was an award-winning legal editor at the chicago tribune. he begins with a question: ""does historical evidence support the historicity of jesus? does current science support the existence of a creator god? does it make sense to have faith in god?"" and then travels north america, interviewing acknowledged, academic experts on the question at hand. 

some rather shrill and not entirely rational attacks on the web  protest: ""but, strobel's books aren't fair, because he only presents one side!"" perhaps these individuals missed the titles of these books, titles that appear quite prominently on the covers of the books. the first three words of each title is, ""the  case for..."" no, strobel is not presenting the case *against* his topic; he doesn't represent himself as doing so. our christophobic media and academia presents that case relentlessly; why should strobel waste paper and time doing that, when that is obviously not what he purports to be doing? 

strobel's accounts of his interviews of the experts are always reader-friendly, but he never talks down to his reader. if you don't want to wade through the all too often alienating prose of too much academic writing, but want to get to the nub of the issue, strobel is your man.

these techniques worked excellently in ""the case for a creator"" and ""the case for christ,"" but less well in ""the case for faith.""

there are three remarkably strong episodes in the book; these episodes highlight what the rest of the book lacks. 

in the introduction, strobel interviews canadian evangelist turned atheist charles templeton. templeton presents a righteous, enraged case *against* god, and then, tearfully, admits how much he continues to adore jesus, and, indeed, to miss him. this wrenching passage masterfully captures the dilemma of many who have a love-hate relationship with their creator.

in a few brief pages that serve as coda to chapter one, which  addresses the question of suffering, strobel's friend marc harrienger talks about his own pain when his wife ran over their child with the family car. this very brief account is testimony to the power of faith, even in the face of profound suffering. 

in another brief passage, strobel tells of his friend ron bronski, who went from being a vicious criminal to being a christian minister. 

these highly personal passages are what i will remember best from this book; they were the most rewarding to read. 

the formal interviews with the experts didn't do a lot for me, and some were alienating. norman geisler's treatment of the slaughter of the amalakites alienated me with its coldness and divorce from human concerns. it may be true that in war, children are killed with their adults -- when the us bombed german and japanese cities during ww ii we killed children as well as adults -- but any attempt to address such killings would have to be delivered with more compassion than geisler manages to convey. too, there is doubt, if not complete disbelief, among archaeologists as to whether these wars of conquest ever took place (see israel finkelstein.) 

the chapter entitled ""church history is littered with oppression and violence"" was especially weak, compared to other treatments of the same material. strobel's treatment of the witch trials could have been improved with insights from lyndal roper's work. strobel doesn't handle understandings of nazism as a christian phenomenon well at all.

the insistence that nazism was a christian phenomenon is revisionist and divorced from historical fact, and that should be made immediately clear as day in any discussion of the matter. nazism was a pagan and a scientific phenomenon. the pagan swastika was to replace the christian cross. scientific approaches to what constitutes life worthy of life was to replace ""weak"" christian ideas about humanity's unity as god's children and the value of all life. 

this is not made clear enough in strobel's account. 

all in all, i have to say i've encountered better treatments of the question of faith in other books ... and yet, strobel is such a good writer, and his technique is so engaging, that you could do worse than to read this book. read the other two books in the series first, though.
"
1005,"i'm about halfway thru this and trying to decide whether or not to sell it to a used bookstore without finishing.  i kept thinking, maybe it's me, maybe there's something wrong with my attention span that i lose interest in these stories half way thru.  they all seem too long, unfocussed. what they really feel like is novels that have been brutally hacked down to the maximum allowable length for short stories.  the quality puzzles me because i'm almost always happily surprised by the quality and variety of short sf i read in the zines.  i haven't followed this anthology over the years, but this particular edition, imho, shows bad selection and worse editing
"
1810,"an amazing resource to the odd world of chick collecting.  mr. fowler has crafted an exhausting, almost overwhelming guide to all of chick's works and articles about him.  everything is cross-referenced to the point of where the reader is nearly overwhelmed with information.  minute details of publishing histories and changes to individual tracts are documented down to the smallest letter.  the book (presented in a distinctive computer printout style, possibly due to its origins as a self-published work) is packed with charts of pricing info and catalog numbers.  but even casual chick fans will enjoy the &quot;history of the world&quot; segment, which ties all of jack's wild theories into a cohesive narrative, and a segment devoted entirely to fun trivia (there's a list of every instance of the term &quot;haw&quot; for instance).  each tract and comic is described, and info is given on various parodies and rip-offs.  this is a must for all chick fans (both &quot;saved&quot; and otherwise)

1022,"as a history major (undergrad) and former high school history teacher, i marvel at crichton's ability book after book to research a topic down to the bone then flesh it out in an utterly believable and compelling way. for this reason the great train robbery is for me my favorite crichton work, even though it may lack the polish of jurassic park or congo or one of his more recent books. 
tgtr takes us to 19th century london and gives us a plausible behind the scenes look both at the masterminding of this incredible train robbery, as well as life in general in 19th century london. so often history books give names, dates, connections, but leave one with the question, ""yes, but what was it like?"" crichton answers this better than any book i ever read on the sheep enclosure act or most any other dry text. some of it may be fanciful, but it certainly seemed as well supported as many another full blown history text.
at any rate, i highly recommend this book for any crichton fan, master criminal fan, or interested history student. the main character, whose name escapes me, alone is a grand study and reminiscent of a larger than life character from a hugo or dumas novel. very fascinating and rapidly moving. 
"
1652,"you get a view into 60's white america. the only people of color in this book are a policeman, and a caricature. i don't have a problem with other seuss books where they are set in fantasy land and the whole world is make believe. this is set in everyday life, and i think its best left on the bookshelf, it has nothing to offer my child who has and who lives in a world where folks have brown eyes and black hair, not to mention various shades of skin colour. the rhyming is also not entertaining enough to enjoy and makeup for this one-dimensional &quot;white&quot; depiction of the world
"
1599,"i started reading this immediately after the last reh compilation and there could not be a greater difference in story telling. while reh was first and foremost a story teller, pressfield uses one of the absolute worst devices in his recount of a grandson of his grandfather's remembering his conversations with a client who knew the famous alcibiades. this, as previous reviewers have mentioned, creates a large gap between reader and story. but why do this? why use such a crappy method of story telling? i guess it pads the book with unnecessary dialogue. all in all, it's a slow, uninspired, day dream story. so crappy that i felt it necessary to write this review echoing previous harsh reviews.

"
837,"i didn't expect to ""like"" this book after reading the first 30 of 196 pages. the graphic detail used to describe a murder and the early decomposition of two dead bodies made me wonder where in the heck this story could go. and, more importantly, why would i want to read it! where does the story go?

it's a wandering timetable. we know the two main characters, joseph and celice, both professors of zoology married for 30 years, are dead and the forward movement not only includes their ongoing decay, but also their eventual discovery by police dogs and the introduction of their grown daughter, syl, as she copes with her knowledge of their death. it also goes back to when they first met, as students sharing a study house at the shore. they are an unlikely pair, and yet, they come together through mutual attraction and what turns out to be a shared tragic experience, and live--at least according to their estranged daughter--an unremarkable life. the timetable further allows the reader to relive the last day of their lives, hour by hour, from the murder back to the moment they awoke and decided to spend the day together at the very shore where they'd met some 30 years earlier. the layout of the story was brilliant, and not in the least bit confusing. 

the language (british english) is both lofty and gritty--probably not unlike joseph and celice. some of the thoughtful insights about life and death are very, very poignant. for example, when syl contemplates the loss of her parents:

""... her gene supplies had closed shop. their daughter was the next in line. she could not duck out of the queue. so she should not waste her time in this black universe. the world's small, breathing denizens, its quaking congregations and its stargazers, were fools to sacrifice the flaring briefness of their lives in hopes of paradise or fears of hell. no one transcends. there is no future and no past. there is no remedy for death--or birth--except to hug the spaces in between. live loud. live wide. live tall.""

i thought it was a very elegant way of illustrating both the fact that life always goes marching on, and the importance of our obligation to the dead (and dying) that we live life well. the title and thesis of the book are one and the same: ""being dead."" highly recommend.

673,"i recently decided to become vegetarian, so i got this book to read. i was very disapointed. i think this book provides good information about nutrional and meals, yet is written in a boring, scientific way. this book may appeal more to parents of vegetarians and vegans and adult vegetarians, than to teenagers. this book contains a lot of recipies, and some of them sound good, but most of them are far more complex than a teenager would be willing to cook. i would reccomend this book to parents of teenage vegetarians, but there are better books written for the teens themself. this book also has so many negative quotes including a whole page of someone making fun of vegetarian food and rambling about how they hate tofu. i don't think these are nessecary in a book for vegetarians, there is enough of that without reading about it. however, if you seriously want to research about being a vegetarian this book won't hurt, it is just a dissapointment

1748,"i really didn't enjoy this book.  i am half italian-american, and i've read a few books about growing up in an italian-american family in an effort to learn about my roots.  i have also read several books about 2nd generation americans struggling to find their identities while caught between what is &quot;normal&quot; and their immigrant parents.  i normally enjoy such books, but not this one.  i know that life wasn't always a bowl of cherries for these familes, but this book makes it seem as if it was absolutely horrible.  yet, i couldn't find anything about the daughters' lives that are really that bad or even different from many people's lives in this country.  where is all the anger coming from?  i really don't know.  this book is dark and depressing.  some say it is funny at times, but i didn't think so.  i couldn't even bring myself to finish it

"
1382,"well, the fact that i'm writing a review about this book, while it's sitting open on my desk next to my computer, open and not being read, might be some evidence of how i'm enjoying this book. this book just goes on and on in complex an unclear language about a subject which shouldn't be so difficult. this book is not clear or easy to understand at all. every sentence is awkward and followed by a footnote, and the masses of footnotes together take up half of each page (!), making this work look like a research project for a phd publication. i have the casebook in this series, and sometimes it seems reading the cases alone will bring more clarity. and it turns to be true! this book might be good if you're advanted-contracts and want to know every little detail, or as an advanced reference later on, to look something up like in an encyclopedia. some concepts, which should be pretty clear just get too in-depth coverage in this book. it's too complex for a first-year student. sometimes it starts describing the different views out there, and then there's a jumble in your head as to what the law really is. i wish the author used his own knowledge and fluid language more than footnoted ideas from other authors.
"
1702,"tim lahaye, jerry jenkins, and others in the pre-trib circle, such as ed hindson, tommy ice, chuck missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that hal lindsey popularized decades ago.  the notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early church, and it is grooming the church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  these men are novices and not prophecy ""experts"" or ""scholars"" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible christians.  why continue to be deceived?  tim cohen, in his excellent book, the antichrist and a cup of tea, provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming antichrist is known now.  not only that, the same author (tim cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture ever offered to the saints of god in christ: the real rapture.  if you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear tim cohen's the real rapture (based on a volume in his forthcoming ""messiah, history, and the tribulation period"" series (see prophecy house's web site for details on these items)

"
1550,"firstly, i have not seen the film adaptation of 'single white female' and so this review isn't tainted one way or the other.  this book, about the stolen identity of a young woman by her psychotic flatmate, is written is very easy style.  characterizations, prose, and dialogue are all straightforward.  i can understand why a film was made based on it since the book reads more like a screenplay than a novel.  and the book's ""feel"" is anything but original.  'sliver' by ira levin does a better job of capturing the essence of life (and danger) in manhattan for a single, white female.  still, 'single white female' is an entertaining read.


bottom line: a very enjoyable, suspenseful read that doesn't tax the brain.  recommended
"
1884,"i was reading about my son.  it all sounded familiar and the concepts and suggestions made good sense.  really talked about a framework of letting the decision making (and the consequence of their decision) remain with the teen. then half way the book screeched in a new direction.  all of a sudden the book went from experienced practitioner point of view to subjective parent point of view.  when it comes to sex the authors don't want you to leave the decision with the teens, they want to take that one back, which weakens the premise they present.

the authors danced around abstinence while never taking a really firm position - which i would have respected, if not agreed with.  then in the middle of that chapter one of the authors invokes christ into the conversation/solution.  if i knew this book was written in context of a particular belief system, i wouldn't have spent the $22.  i would have wanted to know that in advance.  tripping over this midbook has completely disappointed me and diminished the content and message of this book.

"
1814,"other reviews have homed in on the frequent nit-picking and general vindictiveness of this book.  i agree with these criticisms, but i'm not going to revisit them here.  the deeper problem lies with the ayn rand institute, which only gives scholarly access to persons guaranteed to toe ari's party line.  as long as the ayn rand institute refuses full, unconditional scholarly access to miss rand's papers, any biographical efforts produced under their aegis will not be taken seriously by anyone who respects proper academic practice.  nor should they be.

1608,"this is the first of a great series of books. knights & squires, quests & fairies, action & discovery ---- old stories re-told in an easy-to-read style with a dose of dry humor. geared towards older children (my daughter loves them all), they don't insult the intelligence of the reader (i enjoyed them more than much of the ""grown-up"" fiction i read). the series is best when you read them in order, as you meet the characters again in future books. the books were such a hit, i actully purchased them in hardback (gasp!) so that the rest of my kids can read & re-read them as they get older. we're eagerly waiting for the 7th book (and the 8th...) to come out in print!

575,"this book is trying too hard to emphasize in being funny.  it is filled with mediocre 'funny' patters that the readers are encouraged to use, but the quality of the actual magic effects demonstrated is poor.  balancing two forks on the edge of a glass should not be considered magic.  once you read a few samples, the reading becomes stifling, knowing that you are not going to learn anything new that other magic books cannot teach you.  some areas are brighter: the photos are clear, and it blends magician bios and history within.  but one can do better with other books around

1747,"while i only am a little over half way through this book, i'm finding myself hating will.  he's pathetic and boring and not at all a character that i can cheer for.  this book has been a tedious read overall.  i keep pushing through because i feel like it has to get better, yet so far it has not.  i'm happy that i checked this out from the library, so that i can return it and not have it collect dust on my shelves.  the only reason why i'm even writing a review is that i'm so shocked about all the positive comments this book has received thus far.  i looked on amazon to see if my thoughts were shared by others; i'm surprised that they are not.  i usually like this genre of fiction, but in terms of this book all it is is a bunch of whining and self-loathing

1582,"first of all, i did not exactly 'read' this biography. instead i purchased the cd version which i distilled via my car sound system every morning on my way to work (i have enjoyed countless biographies of great american figures this way, and still been able to read many more technology related books).

i had great expectations from this book, having recently enjoyed three biographies of lincoln. i have to confess that i was sorely disapointed. i found the research of mr mccullough to lack the kind of details that i have enjoyed in biographies from walter isaacson, richard carwardine, or doris goodwin. i do not seek a beautiful story in a biography, but rather a reliable source of facts that i can use to form my own opinion of a character. in this context, i find mr mccullough's use of superlatives or long emotionally charged sentences to be a distraction from the subject matter of john adams and his contribution to america. i also enjoy direct quotes from letters, speaches, autobiographies, as they help me refine my impressions of the context (the period, the relationships to contemporary characters, ...) surounding a promonent figure. usage of the english language in politics has dramatically evolved since mr adams' time, and i missed 'hearing' the voice of john adams. instead, this biography felt like reading a translation where the personality of the translator overshadows the personality of the original author. finally, having read other biographies of the founding fathers, i was disapointed to find so little about the complex relationship between adams and franklin.

all in all, my lasting impression is that mr mccullough did a great job at bringing john adams and the early american revolution to the masses through a very appealling product that may however leave readers asking for more historical details and less emotional opinions. had i known that, i might have passed on this biography and instead explore mr mccullough's fictional work
"
600,"just wanted to quickly say i haven't finished it yet, i am only on page 20  but already this book seems very overrated. the author dives straight in talking about going beyond the five senses to achieve spiritual consciousness, but this is nothing new and we are not even given any background on how the author developed his views. instead, he strides arrogantly forward as though he is the ultimate, conclusive authority on spirituality, and it's very aloof and, actually, not an enlightened approach at all! i've just started the chapter on karma and it's really starting to smell like just another mish mash of other people's opinions clothed as quasi-originality. it looks like i'm going to continue reading with a very cautious, vetting attitude toward the text. the fact that this was a bestseller only serves to show how genuinely interested people are to develop their spiritual consciousness - and how easily authors such as zukav can cash in on their hopes and fears. hey, that's the material world for you!
"
127,"dr. hawkins first book, power vs force was interesting and presented a useful way to dowse using kinesiology.  however, he began to venture into misapplication of this method, and has now gone off on a tangent where he seems to wish to delude himself into thinking he has developed a fool-proof way to judge the level of consciousness of any entity, concept, or construct and the truth or falsehood of any statement.  there are serious logical, philosophical, and practical flaws in his work, and his attempt to quantify matters that aren't quantifiable leads to meaningless data that probably matches the bias & beliefs of those carrying out the muscle tests.  this book is a good example to present to show how people can deceive themselves and misuse muscle testing and dowsing techniques.  the actual technique is worthwhile, but much of what hawkins presents in the book is utterly meaningless and invalid.  the levels of awareness that can be tapped into with dowsing are wise enough to not let us ask just anything we wish to and be able to receive accurate, valid answers.  
hawkins explores issues about media, politics, religion, spirituality, history, philosophies, healing arts, entertainment, and more, and reveals his own gross ignorance on many matters.
he seems unaware that many of the people he trusts in politics and media are professional gangsters, liars, and two-faced sociopaths.  he has a negative view of conspiracy theorists, many of whom are genuinely determined to find the truth and don't resort to hawkins' misguided shortcut attempt to identify truth.  hawkins also fosters confusion with his description of his muscle test method, as it really has little to do with applied kinesiology, but is a form of dowsing where the muscle is directed to remain weak or strong in lieu of muscle response moving a pendulum or rod.  i hope hawkins gets to reconsider his current efforts...consciousness and spiritual research are vital endeavors and there are others doing useful, responsible work in those areas.  for now i'd encourage hawkins to recognize that 911 was in part an inside job, many conservative politicians and pundits are corrupt frauds, and the overall maturity of consciousness in america is not greater than the rest of the world

1027,"the only good thing about this book is that it was short. even in writing about a great man with incredible contributions to our country, gary hart repeats himself over and over and over and over again. ok, the monroe doctrine is important, i get it!

721,"as a working mom, this was a book i couldn't resist.  of course, i don't bear much of a resemblance to the mama in this story, but i think my toddlers (both boys) get the picture.  the comforting notion seems to resonate with them that after a long day, mama will come home to the sweet bedtime routine.

711,"are you looking for a way to get your kids into the kitchen, turing out tasty projects?  i know i was--and i went through about fifteen ""kids"" cookbooks at the local bookstore before i stumbled on this little gem.  it was the only cookbook (other than the everything kid's cookbooks) that would actually get a child into the kitchen.  the projects are appealing on all levels--they are easy to assemble, they are too cute for words, and they have super easy to follow pictoral instructions.  

it also has a good balance of entrees to deserts, unlike some of the family cookbooks i've reviewed. and with the desserts--like cookies--it takes one basic recipe and shows you about four different ways to use it--marvelous!  it's also pantry friendly--no star fruit or rare ingredients you don't have laying around.

now if you're looking for a kids cookbook to vary your family's fare, then keep in mind this is a slender picture-book sized volume--you won't find more than 22 projects in the whole book.  for a good standard family cookbook, i recommmend beyond mac 'n' cheese by mops.  

but if you are looking to get your kids (12 and under) into the kitchen to spend some time together having fun at the counter, then don't hesitate to buy this little gem!  it is my number one recommendation for children's cookbook, project-wise.

for the above twelve set, i recommend the everything kid's cookbook because it is a little more geared towards meals and has crossword puzzles and fun foods that are meant to be played with.  if you are looking for a cookbook with tons of recipes that will appeal to your family, be pantry friendly *and* save you money, check out ""cheap. fast. good.""

106,"you definetly should read this book! don't believe what the 1 star writers are saying. they don't want you to know the truth! the left claims that bin laden would never side with saddam because of their beliefs, yet the left is adamant that osama bin laden was funded by the united states. go figure! 

we all knew there was a connection and stephen hayes demonstrates so with great care! there is a connection with al qaeda and iraq and the book explains it in detail

433,"i was at the airport, getting ready to fly out to cali and i found this book in the airport gift shop- i thought what a stroke of luck i had getting a stephen king title at such a juncture... i'm a huge  fan.

"
178,"if you like physics, this is just an interesting book. it mostly discusses, at length, two ideas: emergence and reductionism. doesn't sound like much, and it isn't, but at least it gives you a different point of view on the world. unfortunately, from this point of view to the horizon is not that far. mr. mclaughlin almost calls the present theories (like string theory) science fiction, easy on science (because of the scales and energies involved, he seems to think they are not provable; i don't have the knowledge to discuss if he is right or not), but he doesn't offer much of an alternative. he even comes close to saying that deeper levels of understanding are not possible, or not practical. 
well, even if he is right, which i hope he isn't, between can't and science fiction, i prefer science fiction. tomorrow i'll read a bit of string theory, and shake off the depressive mood left by this book

"
1529,"i wanted to like this book...  i enjoyed the first two in the series.  but this one left me a bit dry...  babylon rising: the europa conspiracy by tim lahaye and bob phillips.

this continues the story of michael murphy, a college professor teaching biblical archaeology.  he is now heading off to iraq to follow a tip on the location of ""the handwriting on the wall"" from the days of daniel.  he's falling in love with a colleague who is in the same area, and he fears for her safety as things start to get dicey in his life.  talon and the mysterious seven are trying to eliminate him, and there are a few attempts on his life.  mixed into this story is a terrorist attack on new york designed to throw america into an economic and national panic, as well as to prompt the un to move their headquarters to the ancient city of babylon.  murphy, for someone who's pretty much a small fish in the large ocean, finds himself in the middle of all this...

as i said, i really wanted to like this book.  the murphy character is likeable, and i enjoyed the action.  but the plotline was spotty and over the top.  murphy was using martial arts to take out everyone who attacked him (highly unlikely).  everything the terrorists tried to do was thwarted just in the nick of time (over the top).  the story attempted to be both a christian end times novel and a terrorist suspense novel, and they didn't do either one especially well.  murphy's growing infatuation with isis was rather repetitive with the ""she's so beautiful"" and ""could she be interested in me"" interludes.  and finally, none of the plotlines wrapped up.  you got to the end and thought ""so?""  fine if you're ready to read the next installment, but not good if you started here or you have to wait some months for the next one...

part of me wants to be nice, give the book the benefit of the doubt, and rate it a ""3"".  but the authors are better than this, and i've come to expect more from someone who's been doing this for a long time...  if you're committed to the series, you'll want/have/need to read it, but just don't come in with your expectations very high..

595,"explodes upon the crime-detective scene. the hundreth man, his first book was excellent and the death collectors is as good and even better. can't wait for the next one!

why this is an amazon sale item befuddles me. but since it is , grab this bargain while you can because it is a terrific novel!

the psit team of lapd, carson ryder and harry nautilus are faced with a dual-time mystery. more than 30 years in the past, a serial killer with a following of mesmerized women who adore him, is killed in the courtroom the day he is sentenced.

and now; starting with the grizzly find of a murdered prostitute in a seedy motel room...it seems as though the serial killer has risen from the dead to continue his reign of terror. each time a new murder surfaces the killer is a step ahead and just out of reach of carson and harry. the touch of subtle humor adds bas-relief without taking anything away from the thread of the story and lightens it tension for brief seconds at a time.perfect!

the murders are freakish! disgusting! brutal! but the two psit detectives refuse to give up and what finally unravels the twisted cloth of this old/new mystery will knock you out of your chair.

a truly masterfully plotted novel with two familiar and charismatic 'partners against crime'. a series to follow and enjoy. get both of kerley's books and double your pleasure!

try them, you'll like them and you'll love jack kerley. i promise!!
"
1716,"i am an avid fan of true crime books and this is by far the most one-sided book i've ever read.  it wasn't about the crimes, it was about this author's personal feelings and dislike of aileen wuornos.  he has a real problem with women, lesbians in particular.  he made ms. wuornos out to be someone she wasn't.  she had a hard life, yes and chose to committ crimes, but that wasn't what this book was about.  again, it wasn't worth the $.  i actually threw my copy of this away
"
1374,"oh, how i wanted to love devon's book! he was such a charming rascal in ""wicked..."" and such a bore in ""sinful.."". there was no meat to this story. the back of the books summarizes it nicely. what would have made a better short story in an anthology was dragged on for over 300 pages. i admit i only made through about half before skimming and realizing it wasn't going to get any better.

there's no sizzling tension, the love scenes weak, and the mystery is predictable. i had such high expectations for this boscastle book since drake's was brilliant and devon's character seemed such a lovable rogue.

not a keeper for me.

1853,"after reading a fine balance i couldn't wait to read another book by this author. i then read his third book called family matters which was good but i was disappointed as it by no means compared to a fine balance. i just finished such a long journey and found it to be okay but very slow moving and downright boring in some spots.  it is my least favorite of the three books by this author. it's hard to believe that someone can right a book like a fine balance, which was magnificant and one of the best books i have ever read, and then turn our stuff that is, at best, average.   
"
1072,"the information is sketchy and factually incorrect in some places, and the book would appear not to have been proof-read - for example the botanical names are mis-spelled in several different ways.   there are much better  books on the subject available

1336,"this was the first collin wilson book i read.  he has probably read a lot to write this book, but to anyone at least a little into the occult it is clear that he have no idea what he is talking about.
if you are interested in this matter (the occult knowledge) as something you would read about but never, ever try to verify if it is true or practice anything, maybe this book is ok.
but if you are serious about it and really want to know what true and what is fake, please stay away from this book.  he is so wrong about even simple things that could have been verified with just a few months of practical experimentation.

887,"some long ago inventer discovered that if you place carefully shapped rocks just so they will remain in place as an arch, dramatically reducing the amount of stone you need to hold up a bridge, an aquaduct, or the entrance to a castle. it probably wasn't too much later that someone recogniced that a bunch of arches next to each other would yield an arched ceiling to a room. my guess is that it then took a very long time for someone to recognize that if you made a series of arches in a circle you could make a domed room. but as soon as one was built, i suspect that a priest of some kind looked up and immediately saw that a minature version of the sky had been created, and that an artist could transform this sky into a 'vision of heaven.' 

this book shows what decoration has been applied to the insides of domed buildings from about the second century to the twentieth. it is an absolutely spectacular set of photographs of how artists have brought the heavens down to earth.
"
32,"i am a huge john grisham fan.  i believe the first grisham book i ever read was ""the pelican brief"".  after that, i was hooked.  i admit that through the years mr. grisham's work has become less ""grishamisc"" and not as entertaining as earlier works.  but, you'll have that with any author that cranks out as many books as he does.  

i first started this book by listening to it on cd.  i soon decided that it would be more enjoyable to read it than listen to it.  i was right!  the book starts out with action and pulls you in.  the action barely lets up through the entire book.  this is a different kind of action.  more mental than physical.  there seems to always be something going on and grisham knows how to leave you wanting more at the end of each chapter.

one thing that is very different about this book than most of his works, is that there isn't really a catch at the end or a mystery to solve.  generally, we find grisham leading us to a thriller ending.  however, in this book, it is more of a life lesson about greed.  there is no bad guy, nobody lurking in the shadows trying to harm the main character, etc.  the book is about good old fashioned greed and how it can ruin your life.  

the characters are likeable and easy to follow.  there are not too many needless chapters or boring detail that is irrelevant to the story.  i found the book very easy to read and follow.  i always wanted more.  

although the book has a different theme than most grisham books, i still really enjoyed it.  it reminded me why i like to read his books so much.  it proves he write good fiction without a thriller or mystery ending.  

if you like this one, try the eariler works as well.  if you have seen the movies, it doesn't matter because the books are always better and usually different in some way.  this book would make a good movie, but we'll see if anyone in hollywood agrees with me on that point.  

happy reading

447,"elaine pagels is a wonderful writer.  her explanation into early christianity is wonderful.  it is definitely worth the time to read this.  she delves into the politics of the early church, the passion, the resurrection, as well as the clashes between gnostic and orthodox thinking.  too often, we forget that what we call the canon is not the only writings available.  she just reminds us that there is this whole other world of writings that did not make it into the bible for one reason or another.  if you want to get an idea of who the gnostics were, read this
"
957,"though i usually go in for tough police thrillers, i sometimes mix things up by reading a light, funny mystery or- like this book- a quiet, thoughtful mystery set in a small town (a ""cozy"", i believe this type of mystery novel is called).  ""still life"" nicely combines the easygoing attributes of a ""cozy"" mystery- quirky, eccentric characters, a small-town setting, pretty much no violence- with a little modernity, in the form of occasional well-placed profanity (though not much) and modern demographics (a gay couple is included among the main characters).

the main detective character, intelligent and interesting, owes a little to christie's hercule poirot, but not everything.  the mystery itself is pretty interesting, too, though some aspects of its solution are a little broad and clunky, as are some of the explanations of why ultimately cleared characters were acting suspicious for a time.  any shortcomings are quibbles, however, and shouldn't deter one from trying out this nicely done mystery story set in a quiet little corner of quebec
"
1871,"i don't know what to say about this book. it is the single worst book i have ever read in my young life.  i feel like i've witnessed a horrible tragedy and am at a loss for words to describe it.  i would say at some point in the book, maybe about halfway, every line of dialogue, every characterization, every plot point, is absolutely terrible.  this book is truly an offense to literacy, and i cannot understand how a publisher of any merit or author could publish and print this trash.  i can only imagine that robin cook either allowed a child to write this book,or was chronically drunk while writing it. either that or he has lost his faculties altogether. i have read children's essays that have been better written.
while it would take a novel to explain all the problems with this book, the highlights are:
-knowing the mystery 50 pages into the book and being forced to painfully watch the dumb characters discover the mystery
-cliche mania with lines like, ""i going to get to the bottom of this mystery"" and when the character's discover something, giving each other high-fives.
-racist remarks about blacks living in harlem about how they like to steal televisions, own guns, and play basketball.
-stereotype characters such as mafioso that like to eat spaghetti and named dominick and vinny.
-incredible suspension of disbelief when the heros, nyc coroners, fly off to africa on a moments notice because they want to finish their case of a dead body. (also paying for their friends to come too)
-wandering around the main installation easily where the evildoers are working, and asking questions, and getting answers to them real easy.
-incredible annoying characters that make inappropriate jokes. (i.e. making sarcastic remarks to a guy holding a gun on them)
-the book spirals into total madness in the last 50 pages to a beyond implausible ending. i got a sense whoever wrote the end of book was on sleeping pills when he wrote it.
if anyone thinks this book is better than two stars, they need their head examined.
"
1233,"this is an extraordinary biography for, while blumenson's admiration for george patton is evident, it brilliantly illustrates all the sides of patton's personality - both positive and negative. the book truly goes  beyond the popular perception of the general -and far beyond the movie- in  exploring his character and motivations. not an overly long book, but  thorough, detailed, and very enjoyable to read
"
1283,"myths are important, but they should not be labeled history.  1.  george washington was not a great guerilla leader; he commanded conventional forces who fought in lines--just like the redcoats. washington thought militia and irregulars were undisciplined and unable to face regular troops.
2.  ronald reagan did not begin the nuclear ""disarming"" of the soviet union.  eisenhower and kennedy tried, but (lbj?) nixon and carter were able to bring the abm treaty, the salt treaties and he start treaties to a point where both sides began cutting back their nuclear arsenals.  reagan did have success with theater wrapons in europe, but the ""big nukes"" that could end civilization were already being cut back.

this is an interesting book about reagan and peggy noonan, but some of the history cited is wrong

874,"this book was written in 1982, updated in 1995. it has a whole section on cameras, which isn't useful since most of them are outdated. doesn't even mention digital cameras. since it specifically discusses the mechanics of cameras, i found this book to be disappointing.

987,"overall, i found this book disappointing.  in its defense, its basic thesis of the movement of jewish american orthodoxy towards the `right' (more closed and intensely religious) is interesting, and i am sure accurate, and heilman's analysis of its evolution is insightful and well-researched.  however, i was extremely bothered by the lack of any attempt to portray hareidi society through the prism of its own value system, or in fact any attempt to understand their values at all. heilman accepts his own world view as absolute and obvious to the reader, and in this context denigrates a society with an entirely different set of goals and aspirations. examples of this include his assumption of the primacy of feminism and the worth of secular culture.  hareidi society has its own worldview which, although too complex to elaborate on here, has valid and very real reasons for its hierarchy of values, reasons which heilman completely disparages or ignores.  (for an example of a book that is not written by a religious author, yet is able to appreciate hareidim from their own perspective try ""real jews"" by noah efron).  in general, i found his view of religion as a mere sociological construct (i.e. a defensive reaction to the holocaust) to be grossly insensitive to the hareidi intense religious belief founded on thousands of years of tradition. 
the latter half of the book i found a pathetic attempt to draw conclusions from insignificant pieces of information.  for example the juxtaposition of poster a condemning something to a poster advertising b implies that poster a is condemning b as well.  or two posters (put out by the same company) advertising two different types of music indicates that the community is embattled over the appropriateness of one type of music.  
in conclusion, although i eagerly awaited this book and found a fraction of it interesting and intelligent, my overall impression is negative due to the authors biased approach and manipulative use of insignificant information.
"
1604,"i was really looking forward to both the book and the movie. unfortunately i think both are very much overrated. character development is non-existent. we're supposed to believe that the haunted, passive, timid character dave was an all-star shortstop in high school? the book had a great premise and good beginning, but went nowhere interesting. the handling of dave's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book's most intriguing character.
"
974,"i'm not a huge fan of this genre of music, but as a very part-time musician, this book was recommended by a fellow friend and musician.  i liked this book alot and found it education and entertaining, even if the subject matter was not of immense interest.  this is definitely not the fault of the author, who did a fine job of making this subject engaging.  

thus, i found the read illuminating to no small degree.  i learned alot about the roots of punk, how it spread and rose, and the end of it.  by correctly defining the terms of the book ""the indie years"", we only see what happens to the bands in their formative years.  once they sign with a major label, their story is ended.  this was both a good idea and frustrating one, as we see the birth and growth of bands, but not what happens to them (in most cases) once they hit a major label.  frequently, signing with a major label creates/expands both the zeniths and nadirs for a band and i would have liked to have known what happened from there.  

regardless, this book is well-written and a great read for any person who likes the bands included in the book.

"
1601,"i received my ph.d. in theoretical and applied mechanics from one of the best u.s. universities, and for more than thirty years was teaching and researching in the field of solid mechanics.  before starting the reading of this book, i was in the agreeable mood with the author's that machines can never be human, and that ai will retain (if not forever) for a very long time its name - unreal.  but, now, i am dismayed.  the author unsuccessfully used 450 pages full of topics in mathematics and physics to support his point of view, making simple topics sound difficult, and making diffcult ones look impossibble.  the inclusion of his strange tilings is strange.  all in all, the book does not make sense. moreover, his 'note to the reader' (which is patronizing, arrogant and deceiving), and his prologue and epilogue (which are at best cynical) should have warned me not to venture any further.  i cannot help feeling sorry for myself and for several other readers; and most of all, if this is the author's usual way of communicating his ideas, for his students.  luckily, i did not buy this book; for one person, who could not stand reading through it, dared me to finish his unfinished endeavor
"
744,"from the cover and a quick glances at some of the colorful photo filled chapters, this book seem promising at first. but the cliched saying of never judge a book by its cover has taken its toll. this book provides marginal advice on how to -potentially- make a profit from the wonderful world of digital photography, however, it fails to give any real world working model on how this can be accomplished. 

most of the marginally useful advices and sales model, i.e. pricing structure on stock photos, are based on the author's own personal preference and experience, rather than taking into account the wide breadth of pricing methods that exist in the real world of photography.

this is a great book for amateurs that are trying to break into the business of selling their prints from an outline or a strict table-of-content perspective of the available methods and channels of distribution to target, e.g. card stock, stock photo, art fairs, etc. 

most of topics cover seem to be more 'theoretical' than actual real-world hands down information and the author seems to expend more time, energy and care in expressing his disdain (with a condescending overtone, might i add) toward enthusiastic amateurs that aim to make it big and quick. his favorite recurring adjectives for such amateurs includes, but certainly are not limited to: prima donnas, pretentious, and pretend aficionado. heller may be a [self-aggrandizing] professional photographer, but anyone with such high caliber should be more helpful, than pompous or supercilious. remember heller, you were an amateur at one point too.

further more, heller likes to take a seemingly interesting idea, get your hopes up and then tell you why you shouldn't pursue it because the odds are just too high against you.

bottomline: if you are serious about licensing your photographs for use, then this book does not really cover the core foundations that you need to get your feet wet. on the otherhand, if you want to take a look at what you can do to -potentially- make a profit from your hobby, then this book basically gives you an -general- idea.

i'd give this book a 1-star for the lack of usable information and the author's cockiness, but it does contain some interesting theories and sales model to warrant a 2-star rating

107,"i bought this book in lieu of the 2005 guiness book of world records, and i don't regret the decision at all. 

this is a huge book- 250 pages- with thousands of interesting and bizzare tidbits in categories such as ""amazing earth"", ""body and mind"", ""wonders of science"", ""fun and games"", and ""beyond belief"". i had never watched the ripley's show or read any other ripley's books before. the facts are just as fascinating as in guiness, but they are presented in a more fun, colorful, and kid- friendly way.

this would make a great present for any kid (or grown- up kid), even for those who don't read much.

the editing isn't the greatest, and i found one fact that is repeated twice in two different sections (see if you can catch it!) but i still give it a full 5 stars!

and... the cover makes me kind of dizzy, but that's okay. ;-

1863,"this truly excellent collection of singer's stories (all originally composed in the yiddish language) are as colorful as the people about whom the stories were written. here are tales of weddings, of jokesters, of happy occasions of all variety, of feuding farmwives, and of unrepentant fools. after reading through a handful of singer's works, a person gets the feeling of how it must have been to live as a jew in eastern europe a hundred years ago. this was a culture rich in its traditions and lore, a people who loved life and kept their identity through good times and bad. singer, himself born and raised in the region so many of his short stories describe, was one of very few authors i would unhesitantly dub ""a human treasure""

794,"my two boys, ages 3 and 2, both pull this book off the shelf over and over. i use it to teach the younger one new vocabulary (both in english and spanish) and the older one to continue to practice his numbers (also in both languages), as well as colors. it's a great addition to the workbook flip flop spanish, and also just for fun.., my littlest, a one-year-old girl, even looks at the pages and will sit with the boys to watch them. they're sturdy pages, full of all kinds of things. the kind of book you find something new each time you open it. it has little lists to find items as well.

404,"the book is obviously well-researched and the chapter on the riders was interesting.  however, the author included a lot of details that just really didn't matter-as if he threw in the entire contents of his research rather than sifting out the relevant facts.  the photos and illustrations that he used were illuminating and contributed to the educational value of the book.
my professor was able to bring dr. schrag to talk to our class.  he was a good lecturer-keeping the class' interest with humor and introducing us to new ways to look at photography and the metro.  if he could make his writing style more like his teaching style, i think he would have much more success as an author

1571,"david baldacci has a knack for writing fiction that sucks you in and holds you no matter what the story.  part of the talent is to introduce interesting characters.   this book is no exception.  sara evans is a clerk working for a supreme court justice.  she is quite close to another clerk (michael fiske) who works for a different judge.  michael asks sara to marry him but sara really loves michael's brother john, who sara has only seen once and never officially met.

michael comes across an appeal that intrigues him (to say exactly why would be a spoiler and it is only revealed very late in the book as to exactly what intrigued him) so much that he pulls it out before it is filed and goes to visit the requestor.  that happens to be a rufus harms who is serving a life sentence in an army prison for murdering a girl.

when michael goes to see harms, practically all hell breaks loose and harms realizes he is in danger himself and some mysterious evil guys from the prison murder michael.  apparently there was some secrets in harms appeal that some powerful unknown men do not want known.

michael's murder is investigated by his brother john (an ex-cop who is now a defense lawyer for the lowest of the low criminals) and he enlists the aid of sara who was close to michael and knows some things about michael.  sara is instantly in love with john and the more they start investigating the more they put their lives at risk from the unknown powerful men.  additionally, the police start to suspect john of the murder of his brother especially when he is named as the sole beneficiary of michael's life insurance.

meanwhile rufus harms has escaped prison from some of those men that tried to kill him.  

so we have tension throughout to see if rufus will survive as well as john and sara before the evil guys get them.

there is a lot of good information about what goes on behind the scenes at the supreme court.  a good rea
"
939,"a mind-opening look into the vicious thought patterns depressed people suffer from, this book has been more helpful to me than years of therapy *and* a degree in psychology. (although i'm not giving up the meds just yet). i'm amazed by how clearly yapko explains the cognitive distortions we have. the case histories he describes are priceless.
 
 on the &quot;negative&quot; side, yapko can be just a bit condescending at times; it's clear he thinks his way is the only way. and although he mentions other theories of depression, he favors the &quot;nurture&quot; theory of ineffective learned thought patterns, claiming that only a small percentage of depression is biochemical in nature. (maybe next lifetime he'll be a woman and get to experience menopause. ;)
 
 yapko also has an unfortunate habit of calling depressed people &quot;depressives,&quot; which is the kind of labeling we could do without. 
 
 the most serious criticism i have is that his &quot;learn by doing&quot; exercises are sometimes impractical, if not downright silly. for example, to learn about perceived control, yapko writes, &quot;spend a few days asking [a partner] for permission to do everything, such as 'can i go to the bathroom?'&quot;. (can you imagine how much your spouse would enjoy that after the third day?) other exercises tell you to &quot;interview at least a dozen people&quot; or &quot;sometime when you feel playful, experiment with trying to motivate people to do impossible things&quot; like flying. what depressed person feels playful? many of these exercises would be highly embarrassing, and certainly not within the realm of a depressed person's capabilities--especially those of us who are &quot;older&quot; and have physical disabilities. however, i do plan to complete the written exercises. 
 
 having outlined these minor drawbacks, i have to say it's an excellent book--after all these years, i finally have hope about rising from the ashes of depression.

659,"this is an overwritten and overhyped piece of fiction that will never pass for great literature. it is timely but it is not timeless.  

not one character comes alive even though they all talk endlessly. not one scene is memorable. the true nature of the book -- soap opera-- is cloaked under its many pages.   messud is a good writer who in this instance could not tell a good story, and she seems to have believed her publicity machine.  i can't believe that her husband, who a great literary critic, would not talk her out of publishing this.  oh.  i forgot.  money and fame trumps quality every time.
"
1754,"this book is not about india or indians.  shallow characters.  non existant plot.  a dismal end to a not terrible beginning.  unlike one of the other reviewers, i was unlucky enough to buy this book - what a waste
"
553,"this book started off very slowly for me.  i got pretty tired of the gender bending deception - how could she be so stupid as to think he was stupid enough to believe his charade for that long in that close of company???  once the air was cleared, the book picked up speed and ended quite well.  i give the book 4 stars because it did cause me to shed a few tears at one point.  all in all, a very enjoyable read.  past about the halfway point
"
1764,"i wrote this review because i felt that none of the reviews so far really got the main cause of this book. this is not a book about cosmology (as people would expect from roger penrose). in this tiny book, penrose summarizes his idea that the mind cannot be understood by mathematical processes (something much different from the opinion of 99,99% of neurobiologists, such as steven pinker). this view is near to the nobel laureate murray gell-mann. the book is easy to understand and the ideas are very concise and its recommended for the ones that are interested in intelligence theories (thus, the author assumes that the reader know what a neuron is and how it works!). some may think this is a difficult to understand book because they didn't had in mind that this book is about penrose's point of view on intelligence. in fact, i'm not a physicist, nor a biologist, simply a high school student and i found the book very easy to understand, although i do not agree with penrose's point of view. i think he forgot something very important. read it and read the other point of view and you'll find what it is! :
"
1718,"i enjoy reading sports fiction with my 10 year old son.  the descriptions of this book suggested it addressed important themes which transcended basketball.  however, as i read the book, i found the treatment of those  themes quite superficial.  in addition the book was bawdy.  while it may  accurately reflect locker room mentality,  many readers may not find that  mentality entertaining.  it is not an appropriate book for children
"
904,"having attended the fictitious ""grove school"" bingham describes in this book, i am confident in saying that it is all true.  we are all indeed messed up and destined for the ivy league.  in any event, the fictitious ""fairfield academy"" does also exist.  i frequent the grove house of pizza and i highly recommend the chicken cutlet sub.  bingham has written a fine text and i only wish he were alive to read these reviews now.  hip hip hooray
"
550,"i'm a zone diet believer - but this book is a serious letdown.  two major problems with this worthless book:
1. almost all of the recipes involve *far* too much preparation - the title is *very* misleading.
2. i find it hard to believe that anyone actually prepared these recipes, and thought they were *good*!  most of the meals are horrible due to the *huge* proportion of vegetables.  i mean, an omelet with over 3 cups of asparagus??
"
1111,"how can a best-selling author like simon winchester take an event as exciting as the san francisco earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze-fest? one answer: write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases. another: strive to break the record for most clich?s in a single paragraph. finally: write about events in 1906 as if no one but simon winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus, everything in this tedious narrative becomes about simon. simon and the raccoons; simon on the failing american economy; simon attempting to reproduce american accents. this is a cd set for avoiding

"
165,"although i am a psych student with a pretty good gpa, i find this book difficult to understand. the difficulty seems to come from the authors' desire to condense as much information as possible in just a few hundred pages. this leads to a cryptic language, where some terms are defined only once and some sentences become a string of such words, a thing which ,personally, frustrated me
"
379,"in the grand tradition of rational corp - this is an overpriced book from rational corp to complement its overpriced software. i must commend the healthcare example in the book that is described in fair detail.  the book's website is empty and does not supplement the book's content - only contains a link to order the book and an email to contact the authors. if you have to buy it, buy a used  copy or read the free marketing stuff on the rational website
"
210,"...this book is a romance, and i liked it.
my only excuse is, it's a classic romance!
i loved it, in fact. it's on my top ten favorite books list. it wasn't gross, it wasn't weird, it wasn't annoyingly romantic. i loved it. (i might say that a few more times.)
i loved elizabeth, jane, mr. bennet's relations with mrs. bennet, mr. darcy, mr. bingly, mr. collins (my cousin cannot say his name without falling over herself laughing from what she saw in the movie.)
i can't even find words to describe how much i loved this book. i read it this summer, and i'm still at a loss for words! 
all i can say is, i'll definitely be picking up more classics. and my book of jane austen's works will soon be veeeery well-worn
"
1319,"as a beef eating hindu i am very much interested in finding how cows became holy for hindus and beef a forbidden thing to eat. i browsed through this book in a book store and found it to be very disappointing.

first, it appeared to be intended more for creating controversy than for informational purposes. it clearly had a bias which turned me off.

second, i am generally up-to date on current issues and remembered that it did not generate all that controversy as mentioned on the cover of the book. there were some rumblings but nothing of the sort described on the covers (""the government of india demands be ritually burned"").

later i searched on google with the book title and words ""ban"", ""government of india"" and found no news reports relating any government of india attempts at banning this book. there were no reports on ban by allahabad high court either. all i found were book reviews on the book and other articles written mainly by political commentators known for their leftist opinions. 

third, i found some material on internet on how the author misinterpreted much of the scriptures to support his conclusions.

it basically left me disappointed and i am still searching for some reliable and accurate material on this matter.

"
1575,"i'm perhaps the only steinbeck lover not to have yet read ""grapes of wrath"" or ""east of eden.""  instead i have focused on ""of mice and men"" and his lesser known works, such as ""to a god unknown"" and, my personal favorite, ""pastures of heaven.""  i've been enamored with his ability to vividly craft characters in particular.

when i began reading ""in dubious battle,"" it appeared the most engaging of all steinbeck's work.  telling the story of american communist party workers jim and mac, it begins with the story of hardscrabble jim initiating himself into mac's radical cell.  there is a great (and misleading) sense of intrigue - mac and jim travel by boxcar, work secretly through letters, go from secret contact to contact and finally arrive among disgruntled orchard workers.  early on, the pace is fast, exciting, and engaging.

suddenly, steinbeck simply fails to deliver, leaving the reader wondering when he's going to pick up the pace again.  after jim and mac slowly initiate a worker's strike, i expected the sense of excitement to continue.  it simply never does.

summary of ""in dubious battle"" - workers get mad.  workers get tired.  workers get mad.  workers get tired.  workers get mad.  workers get tired.

the rest of the book mostly concerns jim and mac talking - and talking - and talking - and talking.  and while their philosophical chats are mildly interesting at first, they simply repeat themselves for the rest of the book.  most of the action takes place in the dark or far away from the narration, and most of the story simply concerns the strikers bickering over petty nonsense...

...and eating.  steinbeck must have been peckish while writing this story, because at least a good 25% of the story concerns finding, eating, and (worst of all) talking about food.  there is plenty of action that steinbeck could have shown during the story, but for some reason he prefers to focus on jim and mac endlessly walking from tent to tent in their encampment, discussing whatever comes to mind.

steinbeck's sense of intrigue and social injustice is worth reading the first few chapters.  but i advise any reader of ""in dubious battle"" to take this course - after the strike is initiated, simply set the book down.  you won't miss anything.  nothing of great import happens, and only a very few memorable characters ever surface, and they are lost among the sea of forgettable faces.

i suppose now i'll give ""grapes of wrath"" a go.  perhaps if it isn't one of his ""greats,"" it isn't worth reading
"
999,"i was really looking forward to both the book and the movie. unfortunately i think both are very much overrated. character development is non-existent. we're supposed to believe that the haunted, passive, timid character dave was an all-star shortstop in high school? the book had a great premise and good beginning, but went nowhere interesting. the handling of dave's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book's most intriguing character.
"
932,"i was impressed by the value and quality of this book.... outstanding!!!!

it is all his plays and poems in one place with a nice look and feel to the book (for the price) you can't beat it.

"
1943,"i believe that the purpose of this book is to break the bad habbits that every single christian had adoptded and the negative infuences we've been absorving.

i think that this book was made simple, so that it would be very easy to read, understand, use and remember the ""be's"". 

it does not anti with anything, it's just conservative with what is believed to be true!

it's inspiring that would help anyone who reads to envision grabbing your dreams and on how lucky we are to be in this generation with full of opportunities. 

every chapter gives wisdom why do we have to be; grateful, smart, involve, clean, true, positive, humble, still and prayerful
"
1896,"a great book for every usability practitioner.  not only did i find the content of this book very informative and very useful, but in particular i liked the structure of the book and found it extremely usable.  each  chapter contains context information at the beginning of the chapter, an   out line of the chapter, summary notes on the side bar for quick review,  sample techniques and forms, war stories, estimation of resources required  to complete each step, etc this structure makes the book one of the most  usable books i have ever used, and therefore one of the most useful  companion in designing the user interface
"
531,"i found two paperbacks at work, which were both thriller series, both written by women, both having two word titles with the first word being ""blind.""  one of the two i found exciting and satisfying, and eagerly read it.  that was not this book.

at first, i thought it was just me.  unlike others, i found it easy to get into the book.  but i found it too new age for me.  between eve talking to her dead daughter to the creepy aldo to jane's connection with the murdered cira, i decided i didn't need to read the whole novel and checked to make sure jane and trevor survived.  

maybe this wasn't iris johansen's best book.  but i'm not going to be trying any of her others, based on this one
"
429,"children love to follow instructions, step by step, and this book has an over abundance of unnecessary and inefficient steps that can make a simple recipe that would normally take 20 minutes to prep, drag on for hours. any adult, who cooks like this doesn't cook often, cooks professionally or spends most of their waking hours in a kitchen.

for example, who in a modern home kitchen cuts a stick of butter, melts it in a pan then pours it into a (plastic, microwave safe) mixing bowl? great, now there's a pan, a knife and a cutting board to wash! it is a children's cookbook, so why not cut down on time spent with knives, stovetop flames and inevitable messes by just melting the uncut butter in the plastic mixing bowl with the microwave?
  
nice pictures, large font, recipes are great, but (in my opinion) obviously written by someone working in a fully staffed professional kitchen, not a home. 
"
1174,"this book is simply incredible.  a more stimulating book i couldn't  imagine!  it's not that it told me so much i didn't know intuitively, but  seeing it written so distinctly in black and white really hit home.  this  is one to read if you really want to get a sense of just how dramatically  the world has changed.  neal gabler, tells it like he sees it and has a lot  of research to back up his views.  i love that he doesn't make judgements  or try to press an opinion on the reader.  it's left up to you to decide  how you feel about it all.  i find myself thinking of points he brought up  throught the day and seeing just what he meant by experiencing it in  &quot;real&quot; life.  the only reason i didn't give it a 5 is because i  wish it was a bit more in-depth.  it's so engaging that i can imagine an  entire college course being made from this book.  it is a book that's as  entertaining as it is informative, and that's the whole point
"
749,"the miernik dossier was shockingly good. before this, i had never read anything by mccarry. in fact, i had never even heard the man's name. i was lucky to come across a review of this re-issued work in a magazine. now i am collecting everything by him.

the story follows an odd assortment of people, some of whom may or may not be intelligence agents, as they travel south through europe into africa. for the entire length of the book you will be wondering and guessing and probably changing your mind many times as to who is working against whom and trying to figure out if miernik is who he says he is. the writers of the dossier themselves seem to be unsure. in that sense the miernik dossier has similar elements to a mystery or detective novel, but yet it goes way beyond that. it is also a highly compelling character study, with each of the group drawn intricately by the author so that you come to know the characters. this makes it all the more suspenseful because these people who you seem to know or possibly identify with in some way may very well not be who you think they are.

the miernik dossier is a highly entertaining read. true spy literature, in the vein of ashenden, that is enjoyable for those who enjoy spy stories, mysteries or simply great writing. i cannot wait to read this book again
"
1912,"this entire book reads like an 8th-grade research paper.  from an uncountable amount of grammatical and spelling errors to numerous repeated sentences (literally quotes retyped word for word, pages apart), it's difficult not to get irritated while reading this.  the information on weezer is great, but often times the author veers away from focusing on the band and gives too much information on things that even the most obsessed fan won't care about.  unfortunately, this appears to be the only book on weezer out right now, so if you want to learn more about the band in book form this is all you've got.  i suggest just browsing around their official website, because it's obvious that's where the author got quite a bit of his information.  don't waste your money

1327,"i in 1996 i bought and read all the pretty horses first. laughed myself off the train seat in to town.  bought the whole lot and read them in chronological order - re-reading pretty horses on the way.  along with scenes from the orchard keeper, sutree sticks in my mind - images ideas, flavours, jokes, and a personality that i'd rather see more of.  sutree made me feel that i know this man, and could even like him.  great fun, and deserves selfish time to read and unwind after reading.

460,"gaylife on the english countryside is like everywhere, you never know when your bf (boyfriend) gets bored with you. the battle with london's competitive nightlife makes you reguarly ask yourself: &quot;what have i to offer&quot;? the efforts to entertain your bf are as tiresome as the question how organize your own life so it won't get dull. and once you got things fixed you yourself run into this willing guy.  the tragicomedy the spell tells the story of four men, robin, the ageing architect who enjoys his life together with his younger bf justin, a witty layabout, robin's son danny, a georgeous body dealing in superficiality and justin's former lover alex, a well-mannered young man in search for consistency. to find out if they all get what they want is a truly delicious way to spend your time. the story is written out of the perspective of all leading parts and therefore very nicely ballanced. hollinghurst is gifted with a great sense of attentiveness. his characters show many different moods caused by tiny events. every self-assured attitude is merciless exposed. i recognized myself and my friends many times without realizing this ever before. it made me smile and reassured me. i think this is hollinghurst's most post-modern novel. unlike the swimming-pool library's sexual odyssee this is a splintered glimps into life and how down to earth it can be

"
568,"this book is a small bundle of common knowledge wrapped up in an insulting amount of hyperbole and hucksterism (and very bad english).  just how many times can you claim a technique will improve your workouts ""by a factor of ten"" or is the most valuable breakthrough ""in history"" before you lose all credibility?

in the first 30 pages, winnowing out the fluff, i read this:

1) fad diets, bulimia, and steroids are bad for you.

2) gaining muscle and losing fat are biologically distinct processes, so they require two classes of exercises.

3) it's good to concentrate your attention on the particular muscles you are using during weight-training routine.

4) creative visualization and self-hypnosis can help you reach your goals.  (ok, i'm a bit skeptical about this one.)

in other words, this book has taught me nothing of value that i didn't already know.  looking ahead in the index, i can see much more of the same.  i'm afraid i've been had.

i bought this book on the strength of amazon reader recommendations.  please don't make the same mistake.  look, to gain muscle, lift weights every other day and eat lots of protein; to lose fat, do cardio on off days and watch your total calories.  if you're already doing those things, don't bother with this book.  i was looking for more specific tips, but i didn't find them here, and neither will you

657,"i read this book the first time 7 years back and left a lasting impression on me, that's why when i came across it again after so many years i felt compelled to buy it and read again. oh boy am i glad i bought it! since last time i read it i have read many romance novels, many great one and many bad ones too. i thought i might not like it so much the second time around because of all the exposure i have got to romance novels since then but i was wrong. this book still made my heart race, made me smile at joe's attempts to make ronnie laugh and still made me sigh at that sparks of atraction flying between them. 
joe's character was just amazing, and most endearing was his insecurities.here was a navy seal,one of the toughest possible guys, and he was insecure about his upbringing and background. he felt veronica would be ashamed to be seen with a guy like him. he was sooooo sweet. he was so cocky, stobborn and arrogant but he was scared of rejection from veronica. just goes to show how a person's outward appearence rarely show what is really inside them.
i can't find any more book of this series , i am still searching for them. i know i have to read all of them.

1281,"if you've read anything already about these techniques - writing it down, visualizing it, tithing - this book offers no additional insights. and despite his &quot;official religious disclaimer&quot; at the beginning of the book, it is packed to the rafters with the author's own religious dogma. if you share the author's religious outlook you may like this book, but otherwise it makes for very tedious reading
"
540,"while ""talk to the hand"" is inescapably mediocre in comparison to ""eats, shoots & leaves"", a book i found amusing, though not up-to-par to its new york times bestseller status, this book does have its moments. 

however, i was uterrly bloody appalled at the rudeness of lynne truss in presuming to make a comment that, despite whatever way she meant it, ended up sounding like she thought gluten intolerance was a choice. i find it interesting that she, or at least her editors, did not further investigate the disease (which, indeed, gluten tolerance is) before publishing such a degrading remark. 

oh, yes, bloody well sorry, ms. truss, for invading your rude, stay-home-and-bolt-the-door causitive world with yet another irritation which, i'm sure, someone created just so you would have to sit in a restaurant and listen to someone else get special treatment for a fad diet. let's just go and, well, obliterate a genetic disorder! while we're at it, we might as well just make the lactose intolerant drink milk. if it pleases and thanks you, ms. truss, we celiacs will eat cake. (oh, bloody hell, did i just say ""please""?)

despite the fact that lynne truss makes this world out to be such a horribly rude place, i have to wonder if she's experiencing the effects of projection. in explaining how rude we humans are, it was necessary for her to be quite rude, as well. it is not simply the celiac remark to which i refer: i also found her supermarket incident, in which a kid shouts at his mother, ""i want that one, you effing bitch!"", among others, a bit offensive.

as a member of both the gluten intolerant community and the younger generation so responsible for this rudeness, i was often thoroughly appalled by this book. no, my friends and i don't usually hold doors for each other, but, in general, i thank and get thanked in return for a money lend or a coffee downtown. frankly, i find myself more often in the perpetual motion of manners with my friends, as well as strangers, than in a cycle of rudeness which includes swearing for the sake of swearing and no regard for others. i can safely say that all of my friends ignore their cell phones if we are having a conversation, or, if they must answer, they apologize profusely before going outside to talk so they do not offend the people around them.

i have to argue that we are not a select group. in today's world, one sees what one expects to see; one is treated as one expects to be treated. ms. truss, i believe, would find that perahps if she simply lowered her expectations slightly and gave out all the respect she possibly could, she would be surprised to find that, when people are rude, she cares less because she knows that she, at least, is doing her best not to be. if she did this, maybe she would be less likely to jump all over people who are rude because she would not be so worried about her own behavior.

my last complaint is this: ""gluten crap""? you would think that such a sophisticated, eloquent (as she is dedicated to proving) person as lynne truss would have been able to find a better word to describe gluten than the third-year, am-i-not-so-cool-and-bitchin' (?) style word ""crap.
"
1341,"the author gives vague advice, the ""calm down"", ""be objective"" cliche  advice. if you don't believe me, i'm literally quoting him.

although the author tries to make his book seem original, as you can read, it's not merely about imagining yourself in positive circumstances, but mixed with the generic advice i mentioned. this is not something revolutionary, this is rehash. save your money and go imagine yourself in a positive situation, you don't need to read hundreds of pages to do it, or spend $ on what to imagine

931,"i'm sure most people will come to fitzgerald through her novels, so i have to excuse myself as a first time reader who just happened to pick up these short stories.  i still haven't decided if i enjoyed the collection, but they are unique.  i thought the first story was by far the best, but after that, the quality varied widely.  unlike a classic short story writer (someone like guy de mauppassant), these stories have no resolution for the most part.  in fact, they leave you with that feeling of listening to music and waiting to shift back into the  major key.  discordant is the word i'm looking for.  the settings take the reader all over the globe and across three different centuries.  i suspect most would enjoy her novels more (i am certainly heading in that direction to read them next), but i can't say since i haven't read them myself.  overall, i found this collection a bit unsettling, but still well written.  i'm sure her fans will enjoy them more than i did on this first encounter

343,"the opening of the mauritius command brings us some changes, especially for captain jack aubrey, who finds himself in the improbable role (for him) of husband and father of twins. unsuccessful and hapless in his domestic life, he immediately jumps at the chance to leave england and take over a new command. off the coast of africa, jack is promoted to commodore, putting him in command not just of his own ship but of a small fleet. in the course of the book, jack stretches his abilities to the fullest as the british vie with the french for possession of several small islands crucial to controlling the india trade. 

of course, dr. stephen maturin is on hand too. his facets as doctor, naturalist, and spy all come into play in the course of the novel. the previous novel, h.m.s. surprise, involved incredible physical suffering, loss, and rejection for stephen so it was nice to see him get a break in this installment. however, stephen is still haunted by what has happened to him. a dark current runs through him that no doubt will resurface in future books. 

the overriding issue explored in this novel is leadership and what it means to be a good leader. jack has to deal with two very different captains serving under him, one of whom is a silly and vain man who is kind and familiar with his men and thus beloved by them. the other is a brave commander who exercises brutal tyranny with those under his rule. the weaknesses of both men lead to very different disasters. 

in spite of the battles and some serious turns of event, the mauritius command involves more action and comedy and less angst than h.m.s. surprise, making it a lighter read.

1691,"today, i heard sister prejean speak about her book dead man walking and about all of the experiances that shes been through concerning the death penalty.  nothing less than amazing.  dead man walking calls upon the unjustices in the death penalty but also on the actual death penalty victims.  many people think that death penalty victims are just plain bad people.  read this book.  if you want to be challenged on your views, read this book.  you can't be idle on the death penalty.  also, coming soon is the death of innocence.  sister prejean spoke on the content of this book and the stories within it.  once again, nothing less than amazing.  a story that is priceless to hear and will influence your life

1585,"mark twain once said that (and i paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. that is my experience with this book. for some reason, a tale of two cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and i figured it was one of those books i should have under my belt. so i picked it up. what a slog! a book that might have been fascinating due to its french revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. we were supposed to shed tears for sidney carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for lucie manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. the only thing i liked about this book was how madame defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. an admittedly cool concept. maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe i don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe i couldn't relate, but a tale of two cities bored me to tears.

1337,"jmaes joyce takes us on stephen daedalus' interior journey from pre-teen as son of a country gentleman to young adult who wanders the streets of dublin, struggling with sin, salvation, intellect, ambivalence about his homeland, and his father's decline.  it is not a linear path, but then whose is?  the story is not so much about the artist as a young man, but about a young man's journey to artistic sensibility, its pretensions and exhilirations.

211,"a well-researched look at aviation that reminded me of the novels of nevil shute.
my favorite chapter was friday norton qa 11:50am. a perfect description of the working methods of a certain veteran tv newsman who just retired at age 88.
of course there are plot holes. the heroine a single mom researching the cause of an air incident is in jeopardy from union thugs and has initially has guards. but as the jeopardy increases, the guards aren't there. no followup mention. what happened to them?
some vulgarity in language.
but all in all, a great fun read.

1662,"i'm trying to figure out what the appropriate subtitle for this book should be and i can't decide among the following:

    * travels through guilt with the world's 33rd richest hippie
    * the mind of an empty suit
    * a self-important revisionist history
    * how i learned to hate myself and love the third world
    * memoirs of a cold war paperpusher

confessions of an economic hitman by john perkins is an exclamation point riddled history of a few financial manipulations of the cold war by a man who had no stake in his own ambition.

the first thing you notice about this account is that it is written by a man who thinks he was sitting on top of the world, when in fact he was just a cog in the energy industry. if you are credulous enough to believe that the debts and revenues associated with the energy business is indeed the core principle of the global economy, then the moral outrage of this book makes sense. but there's a whole lot to swallow.

on the plus side, it's a fast and somewhat entertaining read. otherwise it is a exercise in the slow revelations of a kind of self-loathing that takes about 20 years to surface.

one of the things that i've had in mind as i was reading this screed was the sense of geography as destiny. as i look at the 20th century, i think of most of it focused on the economics of . perkins was one of the people who made the truth a narrative of economic exploitation. he falls in love with socialist charismatics in latin america, rues the lives of poor peasants, and bemoans the basic nature of corporate capitalism without ever acknowledging or even understanding the basic nature of socialism.

perkins is a perfect example of a cultural relativist. a perceptive reader can see how much he hates his hometown and parents and idolizes romantic ideals associated with revolutionary rhetoric. but you can't imagine that he even had the temerity to read marx, weber, engles, friere or anyone. back when i was a bit more blackified, i referred to such people as culture vultures. if it's indigenous, it's good. but you'll never see him once talk about infant mortality statistics, literacy rates, crime rates or even inflation.

i discovered a bit too late that this book would teach me nothing about the business of foreign direct investment or the workings of the world bank except that he saw it as evil. technically, you'll get a great deal more insight reading wikipedia. basically, perkins assumes that his game was the only game on the planet, his company was smack dab in the middle of it and that it was all being subtley directed by the cia and nsa and that this is, was and always will be the american way. you really get a foggy view of the evil empire of america from perkins, who resembles nobody quite so much as a cynical wanker who is too soulless to quit the game. it's a confession all right.

by the time i got 2/3rds of the way through, reading the book began to become annoying. the incredible vacuity of this man was staggering. there are no personal relationships in the book worth speaking of. he found loyalty only to his bosses worth mentioning. it is a stunning revelation about his character that he never once had a kind word to say or any personal quality worth mentioning about his staff that stands out in memory.  we learn that he took one of his charges (female) on a yacht cruise to some isle in the caribbean, but that when he got there, he was so sickened by his guilty conscience that he banged his head against the coconut trees.

if you want to understand something about the life of an economist and high finance, the best book i've read is my life as a quant. if you want to understand something about the life of a reluctant spy, the best book to read is larry kolb's overworld. if you want to get well-written account of a man who was too spoiled to find himself while being a toady in the economic hardball of the cold war era, then this is your book. but it's nowhere near as good as, say the quiet american.

you can imagine that perkins, who is a great admirer of graham greene, might have had aspirations to be such a character as greene might pen. he is earnest to tell such a story that would portray himself thus, but he is to honest to consider himself heroic, and i suspect that he'll be working off his guilt for the rest of his life. in that regard, 'confessions of an economic hitman' is (now prefaced and extended in the paperback edition) a blueprint for american liberal guilt. if there was ever someone who truly believed that global warming and a host of other blowbacks are destined to doom america to a well-deserved kharmic smackdown, it is john perkins. he has always been a citizen of the world pretending to be a patriotic american, down to the repetitions of his undying faith in the words of thomas paine. you'd think, being a pseudo-economist, that he'd have some room in his heart for alexander hamilton. ahh but that would mean that he'd have to admire courage.

i didn't want to be a harsh judge of perkins. i thought i might learn of an extraordinary life, one of conviction and then epiphany. instead i learned of a small yapping dog who was always on a leash he lacked the spirit to gnaw through.  someone who would tell us in the end that we should use less oil and that 'corporatocray' is evil. this book has been a disappointment in many ways. i may well be very happy to read thomas friedman after this.

good parts?

yeah there are a few. he speaks about a few south american presidents who might have been contenders. he gives a few details about saudi aramco. but compared to larry kolb's fascinating and detailed portraits of daniel ortega and adnan khashoggi, this is romper room. if perkins thought he was an agent... don't make me laugh
"
573,"if you liked whyte's previous sophomoric efforts, you'll love this.  in addition to being the same dumb, hackneyed story lines and stock characters we are used to from the previous books, this one has the additional feeling of being pure filler:  in no real way does the story get advanced.  arthur begins as a baby, and ends as a small boy.  there are adventures, but nothing important happens.  as usual, in whyte's books, the bad guys are left alive so they can sneak up and do new evil, and as usual the bad guys are pure plot devices and in no way characters.  with all the (totally ahistorical) democratic rhetoric, merlin's brother shows up out of nowhere and they immediately hand him half the power in camelot.  anyone who would read this, i guess, has already read the previous lame offerings in this series and doesn't object to laughably boring plots which rely heavily on coincidence, caricatures who never grow or change, and historical detail that sounds like it comes from a museum brochure rather than any real scholarship.  so go for it.  but please, if you want something exciting that will also make you think, look at the really good arthurian efforts out there--gillian brandshaw, a.a. attanasio, or barbara taylor bradford to name just a very few..

"
493,"the author had a great idea, but he cherry-picked the available info about superman and the writers to get the book to make sense. for example, superman was originally written as a metaphor for jews during ww2. two jewish guys, right at the end of ww2, write a story of a man that has to leave his homeworld b/c it's destroyed... etc, etc.

i'm not critiscizing this book b/c it has a religious message. i'm critiscizing it b/c the author clearly left out clear facts that work against his arguement. otherwise, i disagree with anybody that says it is ""just a comic."" superman has often reflected the current values and attitudes of a large swath of america
"
1544,"if you like unimaginative phony crap you'll love this book.  the proposed animals within this book are utterly stupid and improbable.  an antelope that feels through the snow with its incredibly dumb looking antlers?  a diurnal and terrestrial mammal that for some god-forsaken reason lacks eyes of any kind?  primates that don't evolve to fit man's niche, but instead take on the roles of otters and flying squirrels?  the thing has got nonsense written all over it.  the ""future animals"" proposed for this book were not well thought out and somebody, please find mr. dixon a liguist, and fast!  some of the names he gives these future animals are so stupidly childish that they actually detract from a creature's plausibility.  a vortex? a posset?  what jerk scientist of the future is naming these things?  can he please be institutionalized?  i admit the pictures were well done and pre-teen children would probably enjoy this immensely.  i know i would've when i was 10 or 11, and there's nothing wrong with that, it's just that dougal dixon begins the book in a very advanced scientific way discussing food pryramids, chains of evolution, and ecological niches, but then converts to unscientific baloney around page 30.  all in all, i just don't think it's cut out for people over the age of 12 or so, unless you are just looking for fun and imaginative creatures.  but in that case, why restrict your mind with the laws of evolution?  why not pick up a copy of the dungeons and dragons monster manual or something like that with lots of mythological and imaginary creatures?  i find that books intended to showcase the fantastic, do much better outside the realm of (somewhat-boring) science
"
1232,"i admit, i haven't finished this book.  a friend recommended it to me as i have been having problems with insomnia.  i was interested in reading a book about women's health issues and this one sounded intriguing until she started in with her tarot cards, interest in astrology and angels.  granted, i am not a firm believer in just ""the hard facts"" but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense isn't alternative enough for her!

1141,"f this self-help industry crap. quasi-astrological poppycock at its worst. i can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title. humans are far more complex than the hack man-warrior/female-maiden title what's-his-name gives them. and remember, this ""doctor,"" is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase. your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives, so why do you? let's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self-help industry to the torch. that's a great start to a sane life

332,"one at the front: the really own words of the master are excellent. one must make sure that only 43 sides of the only 7 x 5 inch small book are interviews with bruce lee. the rest consists of interviews with the former  interviewers. however, as a paperback this book costs not really a fortune.  but the words of the master are absolutely worth-while, as already  mentioned at the beginning

786,"this book expounds endlessly on how best to limit the impact of people on the backcountry in the very best traditions of the sierra club.  it's more of a philosophy book than a &quot;how to&quot; book.  if anyone wants to  learn how to backpack and/or camp, he would be better advised to buy the  several books by karen berger and chris townsend, in particular the  backpackers handbook

212,"i am vietnamese and i grew up in new orleans during the 80's and 90's when the first waves were settling down there.  i hate to tell this to everyone on this site but this book is the worst piece of fiction ever written.  like many books written by someone who does not belong to the culture that he writes about, the book takes great liberties with the imagination and presents the stories from the viewpoint of the writer and not the actual people.  the vietnamese characters in the book are portrayed as backwards, uneducated, and simple.  further, the stories are depressing and very few of the characters seem to have any success. if you actually grew up in new orleans during the time that the vietnamese americans were setting root during the 80's and 90's, you would know that by and large, the community pulled itself from nothing to become quite successful.  no real vietnamese american thinks or acts like the characters portrayed in this book.  i repeat - no vietnamese american thinks or acts like the characters portrayed in this book.  the book repeats many of the fallacies that i have noticed in other books written by predominantly caucasian male authors about east asian culture.  there always seems to be 1) an asian prostitute 2) caucasian guy with asian bride 3) asian male in an emasculated role 4) asian people as backwards and simple.  quite sad.  this book reminds me quite a bit of memoirs of a geisha, though that portrayed japanese culture in a better light.  by the way, the lady on which ""memoirs of a geisha"" is based and written about was quite upset at the author of memoirs of a geisha and did not feel that it portrayed her life or her thoughts in any way at all.  regardless, if you really want to find out about the vietnamese american experience you should really read a book written by a vietnamese american

514,"malphurs does an excellent job of laying out the strategic planning process step by step and in great detail.  i really appreciated the fact that he takes into account things like church patriarchs/matriarchs and other church dynamics that are often not addressed practically in ministry books.  he almost makes the process seem easy, and maybe it is, if you are starting a new church or are in the very early stages of a church plant.  however, much of the material seems practically impossible to implement in a ""plateau'ed"" or ""downward spiraling"" church that has been around for 100 years.  the principles are easy and make sense if you have 100% support of the congregation.  that's pretty hard to do in most of the churches i've been in that need strategic planning the most.   that's no fault of malphurs; the book itself is a great book
"
682,"at least this author mentions the ""mockery"" strategy martha/mdiddy tried to use to ""fog"" the public. the ""real issue"" of whether martha/mdiddy committed the crimes, and lack of an effort to encourage an answer to the question ""did martha stewart"" lie, demonstrates some complacency. is it this complacency martha/mdiddy and her pr team try to encourage and promote? is it the ""greyness"" of white-collar crime that martha/mdiddy was trying to play on? is society the ultimate judge about a person's guilt or innocence? if so, what has martha/mdiddy been judged?

377,"love letters has a very simple concept: two people reading letters they wrote to each other on separate parts of the stage. they never look at each other. but within these letters is so much humor, love, and truth that the  play will carry you away with delight.  i read this play as i was browsing  through a bookstore. i just wanted to read the first couple of pages since  i'd heard so much about it. after page three, i didn't want to put it down.  now i'm  buying it for a friend.  don't think this play is a sappy  collection of gushy girl talk or even romance-novel fodder. if you have  ever been in love, you will recognize parts of yourself in this. it always  stays true to its well-drawn characters, which is what makes the end so  heartbreakingly wonderful

"
1624,"a quick search in amazon books under the name ""benjamin franklin"" comes up with 2403 matches. based upon that criteria, many people would say that everything that could be said or that needs to be said about ben franklin has been said.  those people would be emphatically wrong, as has been proven by author and historian h.w. brands in his work on franklin, the first american: the life and times of benjamin franklin. brands expertly brings this pivotal figure in american history, back to life, once more, in this book which was a pulitzer finalist in 2002.

this book is not only about franklin, but its pages are dotted with an unbelievable cast of secondary characters. brands brings the friends and acquaintances of franklin to life, ranging from cotton mather to sir isaac newton.  the book also spans the life of franklin from his humble beginnings in boston to world acclaim as one of the pivotal architects of american society and government. i believe this is the finest biography written on franklin since van doren's pulitzer prize winner of some seventy years ago.

of course, a book about franklin would be incomplete without also being about the creation and formation of america, as the two are intricately attached. but brands' work here is all inclusive, giving us not only the politics of franklin, but his creative genius, business sense and so much more we've grown to appreciate about this senior statesman in american history. 

i have no idea how many biographies i have read about benjamin franklin, but this is definitely one of the best ever. h.w. brands has a wonderful writing style with flowing narrative, meticulous detail and is one of the few franklin biographers who successfully point the reader to franklin's human side rather than keeping the attention on his mythical status.

"
439,"the sub-title of this book is very misleading. it does not contain ""an action-oriented approach"" to raising your self-esteem - unless you count sitting down with pen and paper as an action. the book is centered on sentence completion exercises where you write the beginning of a sentence at the top of a page (""one of the things i dislike about myself is..."", ""one of my emotions i have trouble accepting is..."") and then complete the sentence with whatever comes to mind. for some unexplained reason each sentence requires its own sheet of paper; and there are a lot of them, so be prepared to go through a lot of paper.

sure, completing sentences technically counts as an ""action"". but if you're like me, ""action-oriented"" implies some sort of cognitive-behavioral therapy that gives you exercises to go out and do in the world, not sitting alone and writing out your thoughts. for someone with social anxiety the last thing i needed was more solitary introspection.

branden gives examples of breakthroughs that his patients had doing sentence completion with him in therapy; but alas, the practice helped me in no way. your mileage may vary, but i wouldn't recommend this book to anyone

46,"do you feel different from people around you?  do they resent your ingenuity?  have you been kept from achieving your full potential by tradition-bound brutes who live only for base needs?  do you long for the company of others like yourself, who, tragically but inevitably, are biologically destined to wipe these shorter, darker subhumans from the face of the earth?  congratulations!  you are either in the aryan nations or the clan of the cave bear fan club, possibly both!

(i exaggerate- you could be a nineteenth century english settler in australia, or a boer in south africa, or maybe you just like larry niven, but that's beside the point)

i can forgive auel for the historical inaccuracies in the book.  in the late 1970's when she did her research, we didn't have the genomic tools to reconstruct the lives of neanderthals, and even now enough controversy persists to keep the discussion page lively over at wikipedia.  ultimately we'll never know for sure what the paleolithic was like, and auel's is if nothing else a vivacious fictional suggestion.

similarly, her bloated, almost puffy writing style is excusable in a first-time author, though one wonders what parasite infected her editor.  i haven't read her more recent works, but i imagine she has probably improved.  even with the pendulous sentences clan is not unreadable.

what infuriates me is the casually racist subtext of the story, nowhere critiqued or even acknowledged.  the story reads like a near-literal historicization of helena blavatsky's secret doctrine on the fall of the ""aryans""- who interbred with ""subhumans"" introducing the world to, oh i dunno, domination by the unworthy, blind tradition, suppression of the individual, all the hallmarks of the book's neanderthal culture.  of course, even in this the blond-haired blue-eyed ayla is innocent, overpowered by a brutish thug.

against this master narrative, all the admittedly interesting side notes about plant-based medicine and flintknapping make no impression.  i would recommend anyone interested in paleontology take a trip to a museum or cruise the internet, and give auel's books a wide berth.

also?  enough rape scenes already
"
1935,"i thought this book would be great and was really looking forward to making some of the recipes, but i have to admit i'm disappointed with the recipes and with what i've baked from it so far.  i was surprised that so many of the recipes called for vegetable shortening instead of or in addition to butter.  i know the book itself explains that shortening is used to achieve a certain texture, but i have read in other baking books that shortening is a crutch and doesn't deliver the flavor punch of pure butter.

so i was a little skeptical, and then reading through the recipes, although they are very clearly written, there aren't a lot of extra tips on technique or anything for individual recipes.  the book already assumes a level of competence.

i made three recipes from the book: the essential chewy sugar cookie, the essential chewy chocolate chip cookie, and the fudgy brownies.  all three recipes tasted delicious, so i can't complain there, but the brownies came out a little tough for my tastes, and both the cookies spread too much -- way too much, and i even refrigerated the dough for the sugar cookies. i consider myself to be an intermediate baker and have made these cookies from other recipes in the past with better results, so right now i'm wondering if i should even try any more of the recipes in this book or just give up.  i think it's okay for a ""base"" cookie recipe book, but you would need to look elsewhere for better techniques or to tweak the ingredients

1615,"going to barsetshire is a delightful book, and a much-needed accompaniment to the thirkell novels.  ms. snowden obviously spent a great deal of time reading the 29 novels in thirkell's barsetshire series, and has produced a companion to the series that makes it very easy to keep track of the characters, places, and cultural references, especially for an american who is not well versed in mid-20th century english esoterica.  i also enjoyed the writing style and the well-chosen quotes.       in addition to the book's comprehensive content is its straightforward layout and user-friendly format. this exemplary reference guide is not a flashy publishing house production, but instead keeps with the simple charm of barsetshire in its quality and overall appearance. the original cover art, showing an idyllic barsetshire scene, is lovely.       i heartily recomend the book to all thirkell fans

1915,"this fantastic re-imagining of the avengers is best consumed in this form. yes there are too many pop culture references, yes the hulk is a little goofy and the ultimate nick fury has virtually nothing in common with his regular universe counterpart but i think once your done with this gigantic, thirteen issue epic powerhouse you wont have much left to complain about. this story arc takes the alternate universe avengers from their creation to their first major victory, ill let someone else spoil it for you but its good. the second volume is juuuust about complete as of november 2006 and is pretty amazing as well. this is the best that the ultimate universe has to offer, is one of the few titles exploring fairly original ideas and has not been reworked specifically to appeal to teenagers, no inline skates, teen angst, or first love in this one. 

millar and hitch are a great creative team but their ability to make deadlines is positively absurd. these thirteen issues took the better part of three years to be released and i read every one of those issues as it was released on the news stand. my wife got her msw in the time it took the skrull war to unfold, it sucked and the new series isnt much better. thankfully it has only one issue to go, hopefully well get it before theres a new president in the whitehouse. removed from the delays the series is a pretty impressive achievement, the art is top notch and the story is positively crackin! yes it's ""just"" a super hero comic but its one of the best, so if you like the medium and are lucky enough not to have read it yet do yourself a favor and check it out, and keep an eye out for the second series hardcover
"
1424,"while i think the basics of the book are good, i don't like how fat-free items are treated as always being the best option.  i did much better on the south beach diet, where good fats in moderation is emphasized as well as natural foods.  fat is what makes us feel satisfied.  after years of trying to diet by limiting fat, it was a revelation to me i could lose weight without feeling hungry and deprived.  an omelette made of egg whites and fat-free cheese is not at all satisfying and not necessary.  secondly, many foods are altered in a negative way to make them low-fat.  i just noticed this week that cool whip lite has high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated vegetable oil as two of it's top ingredients.  this can't be better for you than actual cream.  i also prefer the book ""french woman don't get fat"", which emphasizes enjoying food by eating smaller portions of good, natural food when it's in season.  the pleasure of good food makes you stop thinking diet and start thinking about lifestyle.  i feel that the g.i diet is oversimplified and written to appeal to an audience that has never thought about eating right before.  i think this book is  about the mechanics of healthy eating when the cause of overeating is a lot more complicated.  it certainly can help get people on the right track, but i think there are better books available.

1931,"if you have had any exposure to good literature, you will find this novel nearly insufferable. the symbolism is cliche, narrative style predictable and unoriginal, and the book as a whole is this woman's self-indulgent notion that the story of her family makes a good read. if she had any creative ability, she could use her family history as a starting point, but she does very little to distinguish her writing as exciting and fresh. dull, dry, predicatable, callow, and unfortuantly a requirement from a lit professor who has insulted my eight semesters as an english student

1708,"the novels in this series are not the escapist fantasies that many associate with the arthurian legends. they are, in fact, historical fiction at its best. whyte has gone to great lengths to not only ensure historical accuracy, but to weave the stories into historic events. the first six novels in the series (that is all i have read, though it appears that there are two or three more) give a wonderfully plausible explaination for the genesis of the arthurian legend. but the beauty of the books is in whyte's prose. a scottish poet, he uses the language beautifully and creates characters so vivid and multidimensional that we forget the 1600 between their time and ours.
these books will not insult your intelligence, and they prove that one does not need to suspend the laws of physics or distort the facts of history to find magic in the arthurian legend.

1894,"melrose larry green's book is full of quotes.  quotes and information used to back up points are good things.  he appears to have researched by surfing the internet, watching television and legally incorporating the opinions of others.  this is all fine and acceptable.

the problem with ""why the clintons belong in prison"" is when the author (cut and paste expert) attempts his own narrative, which is sporadic, jumpy and poorly edited.  his points are not linear, and show the author's attention deficit.  with a proper literary team, this book could have been something of note but unfortunately it feels like a ""hit and run"" report and reads like a one-sided sensationalized talk radio program.

992,"seems amidst the turbulence and brouhaha of that james frey fiasco, anybody who now pens their auto-bios have to first be as famous and beloved as billy crystal.  but then they can only put out the cotton-candy coney island fluff as '700 sundays' is.  

granted, the book is based on crystal's highly-praised tony award winning theatrical performance about time with his father and relatives when growing up during the 50s et al.  but it's nothing more than an appetizer to fill in and/or tide one over during the day and night kaddish.  yet in ripping a page out of billy's book, it's not hard to imagine how that rapid-fire exchange between him and his agent went.  it probably went something like:
 
""hey, bubby, how about writing a book talking about your 700 sundays with your pop?""

""well, i'm not a writer per se.  i just jot down a few notes here and there, and then go out and perform the material on stage.""

""so here's a few blank pages of paper; write down what you have.""

""it'll only be 45 maybe 50 pages at most; and it sounds and looks much better than it reads.""

""don't worry, bubby, i know people who know people who...you get the idea...at the publishers.  here's their recipe: they'll take your 50 wholesale pages and spread `em out across 180 retail pages.  'how?' may you ask!  well, they'll cut `em in half, then cut `em in half again.  and using big ink letters so even grandmas can read it without their glasses; surround it by a whole lot of white space; toss in some pictures at different angles from your family album -- slap it all together between two hardcovers...it'll be just fine.""

""yes, but...""

""don't worry.  consider it like a vintage bottle of mogen david 20/20 wine, aged a few months before it makes it to the shelves of your favorite corner liquor store hangout.  in this case, the local bookstores.  oh, and make sure you give `em just enough to whet their taste buds; leave `em wanting more and thirsty for more.  people'll drink it up.""

""yes, but...""

""don't worry, face.  everybody loves ya.  just toss in a few tidbits from your routines about satchmo and mantle, you'll be all right.  don't forget now, we've got the sequels all lined up for ya too. y'know `700 mondays;' then `700 tuesdays' and so on.  yes'sir, i can see it all now:  we've got the lock on all those 700 days of the week shtick.  oh, and we'll do some holiday editions too, starting with `700 hanukkahs!'

""you're still friends with that kid, adam sandler, back from your snl days, aren't ya?!  yes, so we'll get you and him together to come up with new lyrics to that hanukkah song of his.  it'll be a great collaboration.  it's good to pass down the ladder to them other kids climbing up once you've made it. y'know god blesses and doesn't forget those things by them who do.  yes, ok, so we'll go ahead from there and do `700 passovers!'

""and it'll be an annual event too, dont'cha know.  just think, when people see chuck heston...may god keep a special place in heaven for him...when people see chuck heston and the ten commandments, they'll be thinking about you too, billy.  yes'sir, we'll have em crying and laughing every year on passover, you'll see.

""oh, and holy of holies, out of the deal we'll get `700 yom kippurs!'   you'll see.  but this will be only for our people, billy, you understand.  so you might have to dig deep to get material for it.  but that's what authors do, they dig deep.  but you already knew that, right?  can you dig it, man?  i knew that you could.

""yes, but...""

""don't worry, face, everybody loves ya!  your books don't have to be earth-shattering or thought-provoking or anything like that.  but hey listen, with a book deal, a books-on-tape deal, and who knows even a movie deal, we'll turn your little leaden bits into golden nuggets.  mark my words we will. 

""and say, since you haven't had a hit movie in awhile...no offense...we're going to get martin scorsese to produce and direct your life story.  yes, it'll be something like 'pinch me i'm still jewish: the billy crystal story' in widescreen and all that jazz.  it's what everybody in hollywood's doing right now.  yeah, no use waiting until your dying or dead already, billy - god forbid.  no, siree, bubby!!  

""so scorsese will do the movie on the cheap, because god knows the man deserves an oscar already.  you know it, i know it, we all know it, billy.  and not just an honorary or lifetime achievement either, but the really big one, see!  and just imagine, wouldn't it be something if you were hosting the awards ceremony and handed marty his own oscar?!  yes, well, we can schmooze on about all this stuff later.

""but for now, with the books and everything, you'll be a one-man franchise, yes you will!  you'll be on the new york times best seller list from now until forever!  it'll be great!!""

""yes, but...""

""oh and well, i didn't want to say anything just yet, but, okay, here goes: there might be plans to expand everything too!  listen, bubby, i know somebody who knows somebody who...you get the idea...over at the networks.  

""we can do a little chris rock in the neighborhood sort of thing.  we'll put a kid who looks and acts like you - about as tall as you - into the neighborhood that you and your family lived in, see.  

""and it's going to be a period piece too!  we'll introduce all the new kids to the stars of yesteryear -- y'know, cantor, jolson, jessel, durante!  throw in some goniffs and shiksas that the cast can work off of every week -- it'll be fun!  

""chris rock is great.  but you can be greater too.  listen, face, we'll make it a celebration.  something like 'growing up mazel tov!'  maybe we get 700 shows out of it.  maybe less, maybe more, but people will still love it anyway.  you'll see!""

""yes, but, well, i'm not really a writer/author.  i'm an entertainer, so why would i want to do any of this?""

""we could make a couple of dollars!""

""okay. i'm in!""

and so it went and so it goes.

final analysis: a so not looking mahvelous, better luck next time, with all due respect, sadly not recommended book.

1050,"the authors have done an excellent job in explaining testing methodologies for component based software. black box and white box  testing methodologies have been explained particularly well.
test automation and automation tools are also covered in great detail. the book also describes integration testing, regression testing and performance testing quite well. overall, this is one of the most comprehensive text books on this subject. i highly recommend it for both students and software professionals.
"
787,"here's a good litmus test to show how good a book like ""breathing lessons"" is--nothing extraordinary happens and yet i did not want to put the book down.  there are no conspiracies to rule the world or cover up some dark secret.  there are no car chases, explosions, sex scenes (barely even any kissing), or exotic locations.  no one changes or has an epiphany.  almost nothing happens--maggie and ira go to a funeral and when they come back they try to reunite their son and former daughter-in-law but nothing changes at all.  to the average reader this book probably would seem really dull.  heck, if someone told me the plot of this book i'd think it was really dull too, but i didn't want to put it down.

the reason is that maggie and ira are so well-drawn and so familiar to me that they seem like people i know or could know.  i think i could go to the supermarket and run into maggie and ira, that's how real they seemed to me.  i suppose ther reason is that tyler allows me as the reader to know just about everything regarding these two characters and their two personalities just come through so transparently in the story that they don't seem like characters acting their parts; they seem like real people.

because of this, even though very little happens to maggie or ira and even though neither of them changes by the end of the book, i cared so much about them that i wanted to keep reading right through the end so i breezed through the novel in a few days.  in all honesty, what i really appreciate about this book is that it seemingly disproves almost everything i've ever read about how to write a book.  this is purely a character-driven novel with very little ""plot"" except for the death of maggie's friend's husband that gets the ball rolling.  everything else seems to happen so naturally as an extension of maggie's personality more than any artificially-generated plot twists.

it's hard for me to find any real faults with this book, except for the lengthy flashback near the end that perhaps goes on too long.  some people may call this boring or dull, but i would call it purely exceptional.  i loved this book and highly recommend it
"
877,"the author tries to bring both the biography of walsingham and a discussion of the birth of espionage together in the same book and succeeds at neither. it is a fine read if you would like a general overview of the time,  but, after reading the title and reviews, i was hoping for a detailed biography of walsingham  or much detail on how he created the group of people who became his information gatherers.  instead, it is a general overview of walsingham's life with references to the work that he did. there are some interesting facts that the author brings forward that the reader might not find elsewhere , but the majority of the reading is rehashed from biographies of elizabeth i. if you want details and a better understanding of walsingham the man, and his life work and actions, you will need to look elsewhere
"
713,"this book starts with the fundamentals of atomic structure and then builds on them until molecular orbital theory.  molecular orbital theory is developed for both organic and inorganic substances.  molecular orbital theory is used to explain the electronic structure of molecules, which is, of course, of fundamental importance to the chemist.

bonding theories for organic and inorganic models are developed and a brief treatment is given on the solid state at the end of the book.

this is a book that i often use as a reference.  this book is versatile enough to refresh the chemist about bonding ideas in both organic and inorganic areas.  it is not a particularly advanced book, but it was a pleasure for me to read and a good book to remind me of the basics when i need it
"
396,"this book, unlike morris's work on hillary, is actually worth reading, because its perspective and analysis of our 42nd president is fascinating. though the title is a little tiresome (and becomes especially so when morris continues to say throughout the book `why? because he could!') the book is a fast page turner.  

i particularly enjoyed morris's portrayal of clinton as one who only came to life around other people: if they were happy, he was, if they were in distress, he felt their pain. a master of reading people and changing according to their feelings, clinton was perfectly suited to becoming a president who ruled by polls. enter dick morris. as clinton's chief poller, he also became, at one time, his chief political advisor. and clinton needed one. 

as `my life' by clinton shows, the president had no overall strategy and failed to see events as interconnected. for him, each issue needed to be examined individually and with clinton, that was a laborious endeavor:  the prez had the painful habit of considering each argument with equal weight, and therefore was extremely indecisive and cautious to take action. result? fiasco's like waco, somalia, bosnia and health care reform. more seriously for the future: the loss of the congress to the republicans (over ten years now and counting) and the failure to stop bin laden.  

morris gives credit where credit is due though: clinton's work on welfare reform cut the roll books in half and the tough work on deficit reduction allowed the economic boom of the 1990s to take place. also interesting, was clinton's use of the presidency as a bully pulpit for families and education: an issue that was local politics, and therefore cost clinton nothing in the budget but brought in massive political capital. 

read this book before reading clinton's `my life'.  why? because morris points out the inconsistencies and just plain untruths contained therein.  also, morris says that the president's autobiography is the `rosetta stone' that decodes clinton. if that is the case, then morris is certainly the interpreter.

"
469,"i was expecting this book to be a great story, but very disappointed. i cannot believe the publisher allowed the author to publish this book as it is. the book is insipid and dull,  has no flow, no story, or no plot. let me present an example. i have read many insightful newsweek articles by a writer allan sloan. for example, sloan describes a sprint merger event in this way, ""if talk is getting cheaper, why did mci worldcom pay $115 billion to buy sprint? the once staid phone companies have launched a merger blitzkrieg in an effort to emerge at the center of the wired world. can regulators handle the complex new order.....""  it has a clear logical axis, and has a force to attract readers into it. 

but jeter describes it like this,  ""the merger announcement of worldcom and sprint spurred building activity around worldcom headquarters as real estate developers readied for economic prosperity. the real estate inventory swelled with new planned unit....."" it always presents off-center, trivial detail which makes a reader bored. 70% of books are consumed to described a dry and dull fact, like ""the merger of company a & b raised the stock to $x"" etc. there is no insight here. 

but unfortunately, unlike enron scandal, there is no other book that centered on the worldcom scandal. you would get much better comprehension by collecting articles in newsweek or business week, if you have lexisnexis or ebiscohost.

but great expectations was a great disappointment! i was somewhat amused until chapter ten where i felt the book became psycho-babble. i was also disappointed in tale of two cities. i could not endure the first two chapters! dickens did a fine job on the christmas carol. but i will never read another of his books
"
436,"as with many of the ""for dummies"" series, controlling cholesterol is a well-executed overview of many issues relevant to cholesterol. author carol rinzler's light and humorous discussion ranges from a concise description of what cholesterol is, to many of the different approaches to lowering cholesterol and why ""target"" values for cholesterol can differ in different people. there's an especially helpful discussion on the effects of various popular diets like atkins', sugar busters, and protein power -- pluses and minuses of each.

""ten cholesterol myths"" in chapter 16 is a great discussion that can help clear up much of the murkiness surrounding cholesterol issues and can help answer many of the questions that i am asked when treating cholesterol in my patients (in my cardiology practice). 

one criticism: like all books about cholesterol, controlling cholesterol for dummies gives the reader the impression that high cholesterol is the only way to identify risk for heart disease, as well as a means of diminishing risk of heart attack. this is patently untrue, but not really a criticism of this book as it is of the standard thinking on cholesterol. there are better ways! nonetheless, this book does serve its intended purpose very well: educate the reader thoroughly on the conventional understanding of cholesterol.

"
633,"over 20 years after it was published, the story of the israeli attempt to eradicate massive and repeated terrorist attacks emanating from the plo (bubba's/jacques/un's buddy yasser) in lebanon is no less important.  interestingly, lebanon is still struggling to rid itself of syrian occupation.  they have gone from the vegan dictator hafez assad murdering opponents and journalists to the syrian optometrist dictator murdering opponents and journalists (another killed last week 7/2005).

in this review, i will attempt to explain the story, the left-wing/doves reporter's views (and on so many levels his mistakes), and most importantly to americans who love and support israel, the correlation between israel's actions and our ""war on terror.""

first to the journalists, the main one being the left wing newspaper haraatz ze'ev schiff.  as the brilliant reviewer givbatam3 points out nearby, mr. schiff is a member of the israeli left/dove/peace now group.  this ""coalition"" consists of myopic people (with all due respect) that don't seem to understand good and evil.  just as our great president bush was criticized for denouncing the ""axis of evil"" (he forgot to mention syria and the house of saud), these doves conveniently choose to ignore the problems with cooperating with our/their enemies.  this is what lead to the fraudulent oslo accords and the creation of the terrorist supporting palestinian authority.  it is this ""authority"" that unleashed a wave of terror on israel immediately after clinton helped the murderer arafat receive a nobel peace prize.  fittingly, arafat walked away from the clinton/barak  plan in 2000, which would have created a palestinian state, which to this day (7.8.05) does not exist despite the charade of the road map.  the authors accuse prime minister sharon of illegally leading israel into the war in lebanon.  most of the books i've read about israel seem to have been written by journalists out to discredit sharon.  he seems to be the donald rumsfeld of israel.  i don't live there so it is impossible for me to get a read on the situation, but he was democratically elected, so most of the voters must disagree with the left's assessment of mr. sharon (yes, i know his ""disengagement"" is an illegal abomination, more on that later.  wear orange to support the settlers.)

on page 39, mr. ze'ev describes sharon as ""a cynical, headstrong executor who regarded the idf as his personal tool for obtaining sweeping achievements-and not necessarily defensive ones-and a minister prepared to stake the national interest on his struggle for power.""  those would prove to be the ""kindest"" words he would have for mr. sharon.  on page 58, he accuses sharon of implementing a quasi-coup d'etat.

and on and on it goes.  the author also accuses sharon of duping the american government, details forthcoming.

later on, we learn of the ""courageous, freedom fighter"" (my emphasis) arafat's decision to deploy all palestinians including 12 year old boys to kill israelis.  of course, to this day the pa affiliated fatah and other groups use children to murder israeli civilians (the best non-child attack recently was the palestinian woman who was granted permission to receive medical care in israel who tried to kill innocent israeli doctors/nurses using ""bomber pants.""  great video of her discovering the bomb wouldn't activate, however us msm {mainstream media} other than fox refused to air it.)

on page 92, we learn of arafat crony and current pa leader abu mazen's (the same oslo and road map violating, terrorist supporting/enabling, holocaust denying, chain-smoking mazen that gw brazenly brought to the white house) recommendation to target specific ethnic types of jews for murder.

throughout the story, if indeed the cabinet was mislead, we learn that this deception had negative military preparedness consequences.  specifically, a failure to call up the reserves.

to his credit and unlike journalists robert fisk (pity the nation) and thomas friedman (ny times, from lebanon to jerusalem), mr. schiff reminds us of the level of terror practiced by ray-ban wayfarer wearing arafat even inside his own plo.  on page 147, we learn of palestinians killing palestinians that were given the chance to evacuate an area prior to idf action.  in this episode, three children were gunned down in front of their father.

on page 149, the authors engage in a disgusting bit of analysis about the minds of idf members.  in discussing a particularly brutal phase of the operation, the author's ask ""was it perhaps fueled by an even deeper sense of vengeance for all the harm and hatred that the jews had suffered at the hands of others over the centuries?""  and further, ""how would the grandparents of these boys have reacted to the scene of mayhem...?""  are you kidding me??  these members of the citizen army were probably quite sick of repeated murders of innocent israeli citizens and committed to seeing their country living in peace.  meanwhile, the un, the left/doves, the media, and others seemed to downplay or turn a blind eye to arafat's involvement in the many terrorist attacks conducted by the plo prior to the lebanon operation.  in my humble view, something had to be done.  prime minister begin agreed with sharon's initial plan on eliminating the terrorists in beirut. 

page 152 features more america bashing, culminating in an accusation that the us was an israeli dupe.

the story of the military operation is detailed completely.  and no discussion of the lebanon operation would be complete without mentioning the incidents in the refugee camps in sabrit and shatilla.  i'll leave it for the reader to decide on this operation, but in short, israel relied on their ""allies"" in lebanon to rid the camps of terrorists.  most assuredly, after the palestinians brought havoc to these people, they wanted revenge.  the result: some civilian deaths to go along with the ""clean up"" operation and a rebuke of several israeli figures including prime minister sharon.  
folks, war is not pretty and the us faced similar choices in partnering with the northern alliance in afghanistan.  many to this day say that is why we allegedly ""lost"" bin laden in tora bora instead of adequately deploying our troops on the pakistan border.  general tommy franks says this would not have been possible and i believe him more than the kerry/kedwards crowd.  our ""ally"" pakistan would not have tolerated a us presence, given that they were one of only three governments with relations with the taliban.

as for the author's attempts to rid israeli society of prime minister sharon, it didn't work.  he forcefully fought the charges emanating from the investigation into the lebanon operation.  after yasser walked all over clinton in barak in 2000 and launched/restarted the intifada, israel voted for ""arik"" and his platform of not negotiating with arafat.  sadly, no tragically, he is haphazardly implementing his ""disengagement plan.""  six weeks prior to its start, it appears the plan is not well thought out and polls show that israelis are increasingly against it.  moreover, turning land over to terrorist supporting mazen will embolden those that seek israel's destruction.  israel expects terror gangs of hamas, islamic jihad, and mazen's own fatah to immediately set up shop in the west bank and begin terror operations.  

so looking back mr. schiff and ya'ari, who was right?  terror coddling doves such as rabin (who at least acknowledged the danger in trusting arafat) and peres or likud hawks such as sharon (and netanyahu)?  

let the reader decide.  i know who i would trust with my security:  likud members sharon and netanyahu.

1280,"when i purchased this book i expected it would be life from a particular  bacteria's perspective.  by this i mean, &quot;well, today our host started  a new antibacterial therapy.  the last round of therapy was tough, but we  managed to make it through unscathed.  i'm confident we'll survive.&quot;   unfortunately, what i read was a scientific book written in non-scientific  language.  as a biology major in college and a medical student now, i've  read many scientific books written in scientific language.  so many that  they are pretty much all i can relate to anymore.  ha!  actually, that  statement has more truth in it than i care to admit, but i thought this  book would be a nice change of pace.  instead, it's a listing of  information about a certain bacterial species that i could have extracted  from bergey's.  the book is undramatic and uninteresting.  i wouldn't  recommend it to anyone

1641,"i thoroughly enjoyed the author's earlier work on how the irish saved civilization.  but this book was a disappointing compendium of greek myths, legends and history that never reveals a plan behind the book.  taken in its subparts, many sections are engagingly informative in an elegant if sometimes pretentious prose.  yet the author ambles from here to there in a disjointed narrative with interesting nuggets but little insight.  where's the big picture?  the author attempts to wrap it up at the end with a sentence about the greeks' ""variety of human response, lightening quick transmutations, resourcefulness, and inexhaustible creativity.""  

a subtitle like ""a greek treasury of personal vignettes"" might have been more descriptive and merited another star. but it falls short as a ""hinge of history"" with impoverished and even maladaptive connections (fdr as solon - really?) to the modern world. i am sorry to not recommend it.

340,"one good knight (2006) is the second fantasy novel in the tales of the five hundred kingdoms series, following the fairy godmother.  in the previous volume, alexander and elena organized resistance to the invasion of fleurberg by a dark magician.  after the death of the katschei, alexander and elena were wedded, becoming godmother and consort.  then an order of champions was established at glass mountain, with alexander as their master, and elena was given charge of fleurberg in addition to her other kingdoms.

in this novel, princess andromeda of acadia is nineteen years old, but is still considered a child by her mother, queen cassiopeia, and chief advisor solon adacritus.  she writes a report on the merchants for a trade conference and impresses both the queen and the chief advisor.  after that, her mother orders redecoration of the princess wing, appoints two ladies to design her wardrobe and jewelry, and assigns a steward to handle her affairs.

andromeda is quite overwhelmed by this attention and augments her studies to further impress her mother.  she notices that income from wrecked ships has grown due to an increase in the number and severity of storms.  her studies and inquiries suggest that this increase is probably due to the manipulations of a great wizard.  she reports this matter to her mother.

afterward, andromeda is resting high up in a tree within the palace garden when she notices a strange flying creature.  as it comes toward her, she recognizes that it is a dragon.  then it reaches the palace and she observes that it is a very large dragon.  it flames some high architectural features, grabs a couple of animals and flies away.

the panic within the palace is phenomenal and the subsequent meeting of the queen's advisors is very lively.  andromeda has quickly reviewed the literature on dragons -- consisting mainly of myths and legends -- and reports to the advisors that the only known method of managing a dragon is the sacrifice of virginal maidens.  the ensuing discussion is even livelier, mostly concerning the means of choosing such sacrifices.

queen cassiopeia states that the only fair way to select sacrifices is by a lottery.  after the spate of crazy volunteers dies down, a lottery is organized.  some women find ways to disqualify themselves, but others are taken by the dragon.  rumors begin spreading that anyone who speaks out against the queen is more likely to have a family member selected for the sacrifice.  but then andromeda is selected.

this novel is mostly about the influence of the tradition within the five hundred kingdoms.  andromeda's knowledge of the tradition comes in handy at various points in this quest.

the queen has sent to glass mountain for a champion to fight the dragon, but the good knight doesn't come forward as expected.  someone has erected a magical barrier at the border to keep out such warriors.  however, andromeda is sort of saved by a champion at the sacrificial site.  andromeda convinces the knight to take her along as a guide and finally proves to the champion that she can be a help rather than a hindrance.

they travel cross-country in the same direction that the dragon had flown, stopping for supplies here and there, and finally enter the wyrding lands.  they encounter unicorns and a fox along the way before meeting the dragon and his brother.  then andromeda learns that all is not as it seems.

andromeda is nineteen and naive.  then she is faced with one of the most difficult of issues:  does her mother love her.  while many events occur in this plot, this one issue is the crux of the story.  even her interspecies romance with the younger dragon is only a temporary relief from this main concern.

highly recommended for lackey fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of adventure, betrayal and romance.

1207,"communism is one of the most evil ideologies in human history, responsible for the extermination of 100+ million people. this book (which started it all) holds at least much of the blame. communists were and still are a threat to the free world, and communism is a slave system. some ""intellectuals"" actually support the tired mantras of marx's philosophy, whether because they are insincere or simply pedants who haven't seen enough sunlight, i don't know. in any case, if they ever step foot in the real world they would take note that communism denies private property, and is totalitarian and slave-driving (the government owns everything, including you). and the deaths caused by communism are hardly necessary to bring up. pol pot, mao, stalin (of course), etc etc...who are these people kidding

574,"this is the worst novel that i have ever read by a major author.  i have read a couple other alex cross novels and i did not find them to be awful at all.  they weren't very good but they kept me turning the page.  while i was reading this dreck i began to get a sense of patterson's work ethic.  he sets a goal for himself and does not stray from it.  one maybe two chapters per day i suppose, and when his muse is on vacation for a couple of months this is the result.  not a snowball's chance in hell that this would have been published if it weren't written by patterson.  i'm done. don't waste your time.  really
"
1902,"this book appears on most of the 'best of' science fiction lists that various pundits and critics have put out, even though it is not a very commonly known work. does it deserve such a placing? i think the answer to that depends upon what your viewpoint is about what science fiction, as a form of literature, is supposed to accomplish. 

the idea is simple enough. a new drug, developed from the bacteria that causes syphilis, is found to have the property of greatly increasing a person's intelligence, but with major side effect - it kills the user in about nine months. the story follows one louis sacchetti, a conscientious objector to a seemingly interminable war, and who would already be considered to be a genius by most standards, as he is transferred from a standard prison to a facility specially constructed to see what will happen to its inmates when given this drug. the story is told through the means of a journal that louis is encouraged, almost forced, to keep. 

as this idea is extremely similar to that of daniel keyes' flowers for algernon (which was later made into the movie charly), comparison is invited. flowers emphasizes the tragedy of the hero, a man who struggles to find those bits of knowledge that will help not just himself but all mankind, up against an unbeatable problem, that of his own retreat to sub-normal intelligence again. camp concentration follows a completely different path, that of the essential selfishness of the individual, of nihilism, of the despair of ever being able to change humanity in any meaningful way. the inmates that louis initially documents are apparently using their greatly enhanced intelligence to investigate alchemy as a means of providing immortality, not for humanity in general, but for themselves and the 'warden' of this prison, humphrey haast.  louis, meanwhile, seems caught up in crafting new poems and a play, entitled 'auswitch, a comedy'. the title is indicative of something disch does throughout this book, playing with names and titles to produce another layer of meaning behind the straightforward words, and is fairly effective in doing so. 

the tone is the primary thing here, a very dark, brooding atmosphere, enlivened by a very wide ranging vocabulary and many references, both buried and open, to other works of literature (most especially dante), and scientific and psychological theories. readers who are not familiar with these references may feel a little lost at places in this book - at least i did, as my breadth of knowledge in these areas is clearly more limited than disch's. but from this tone, disch develops his themes of the corruption of man, of his baser desires, the absolute horrors of what man is capable of, and where such capacity leads. as such, this book is almost the complete antithesis of flowers for algernon - that is, until the ending of this book. 

the ending of this book, i felt, rather drastically detracted from its overall message, as it doesn't seem to fit with the rest, and has a little of a deus-ex-machina feel to it. given the many layered discourse that disch presented in the rest of the book, which while sometimes difficult to follow, was certainly excellent writing, this ending was a disappointment.  

while this is certainly a major entry into the dystopian side of science fiction literature, whether it truly qualifies as a 'classic' will be, i'm afraid, very much a matter of opinion for a long time to come. but it is certainly worth reading, if for nothing else than to see the darker side of genius competently presented.

434,"i'm the sort of guy who has a bit of trouble adapting to normal life. i'm still bemused and puzzled the mechanics of toilet-flushing. my wife (may she rest in peace) bought me this book as an anniversary present last month before she was tragically torn apart by a rabid pack of alligators at a wyoming nature preserve. anyway, life moves on.

much to my disappointment this book did not teach me everything i should know how to do. ""but fred,"" you might be saying (and i'll be saying ""fred isn't my name, idiot!""), ""how do you know what you should know if you don't know what it is to begin with?""

ah, well, let me explain. see, if tchikavoslky taught me one thought, it was this: i know nothing.

so it is with this deep insight into my own mind that i came up with the following things i should know, based on what i currently do not know:

1. how to start a hurricane. this is very important.

2. how to kill a man with a toothpick. what if you met a hitman at a fancy restaurant and found out your were his next victim? scary.

3. how to run a nuclear powerplant with a one-man army. i don't want to be the next homer simpson!

4. how to raise children. i've raised ten and still haven't figured out what a diaper is.

5. what a diaper is. i don't know, my wife used to talk about them a lot.

6. how to drive. sure, technically we're supposed to learn how before we get our driver's licenses, but like many people, i just got a fake one when i was 12 and have been driving since then. i've been in over three hundred vehicular accidents and been charged with five counts of manslaughter, so i figured it might be good to learn how to drive.

7. how to stalk a celebrity. you just never know.

8. how to put on underwear without leaving stain marks. you fellas know what i'm saying!

9. how to make coffee. people ask me to all the time, and because i don't know how, i just take some warm water and pour mud in. thankfully no one's noticed my inadequacies yet, but i'm sure soon enough they will, after another person dies of food poisoning and internal infection.

10. how to kill yourself. i don't want the aliens to get anything out of me when i'm taken hostage. i saw it in that tom cruise movie, and it was sure scary!

so with these things in mind, i'm severely disappointed by this book, and feel it is mis-marketed and stupid.

please, barbet schroeder (or whoever the author was), write a better book next time

663,"when i realized early on the time i would waste on this assemblage of leftover quips packaged around a absurd concept, i resolved that i would alert other readers. 

generally i enjoy this author's works and anticipated this latest tome. i was surprised and dissappointed to find a lengthy novel which did nothing to disguise it's clues or probable developments. everything was telegraphed and nothing was original. the conclusion was so lame that i was shocked that there was no effort to build suspense or intrigue.

my advice is to skip this one and wait for the reviews on his next
"
334,"these are true tales from a clinical neurologist's notebook, but this isn't just any neurologist.  oliver sacks, author of the justly celebrated, the man who mistook his wife for a hat (1986) and awakenings (1973), which was later made into a movie starring robert deniro and robin williams, and other works, is a gifted writer with a fine sense of story and an even finer sense of humanity.  he has a style that is both affecting and fascinating, yet studiously objective, a style laced with footnotes and clinical observations, historical comparisons and wisdom.  part of the power of these tales, and of all of sacks's work, is his ability to be totally engaged and to identify with the subject while part of him is off to the side observing with scientific impartiality.  this makes for a compelling read.  if you've never read sacks before, you are in for a very special treat.

these tales are paradoxical because ""defects, disorders, diseases"" can bring out ""latent powers, developments, evolutions, forms of life, that might never be seen or even be imaginable, in their absence.""  it is this ""'creative' potential, that forms the central theme of this book"" (from sacks's preface, page xvi).

the first tale, ""the case of the colorblind painter"" is about a successful artist who worked in color all his life only to became colorblind at age sixty-five, and the effect this had on his life and work.  the second, ""the last hippie"" is about an amnesiac man with a frontal lobe tumor that left him stranded in the sixties.  sacks tells this sad, pathetic story with vivid detail, and characteristically ends it with a footnote, a footnote of such warmth and genuine identification that we are moved to tears.  (don't skip the footnotes!)

the third tale, ""a surgeon's life,"" is an amazing account of a canadian surgeon with tourette's syndrome.  it is here that we begin to see the central theme of this book in brilliant illumination.  dr. carl bennett, riddled with the bizarre tics characteristic of the disorder, compulsions that cause him to throw things, to touch things again and again in a ritualistic manner, to flail, jump and jerk about, nonetheless became a very successful (and beloved) doctor of surgery.  sacks scrubs up with dr. bennett and goes into surgery with him, during which, miraculously, the tics disappear for however long it takes to complete the surgery.  sacks visits him at home and meets his wife and two children, sees the dents in the refrigerator and on the walls, and comes away with a sense of how astounding the human potential to overcome adversity can be.

the fourth tale, ""to see and not see,"" is about partially restored sight and how it was not a blessing.  this sad story illustrates how sight is learned from infancy and is largely a constructive and interpretive function of the brain.  this tale also lets us see how the world of the sightless can be rich and fulfilling beyond our imagination.
	
in the fifth tale, ""the landscape of his dreams, we meet a gifted artist, franco magnani, who from memory alone recreates his home town of pontito, italy through his paintings.  he has a nearly photographic, three-dimensional memory, but because of a strange illness that befell him when he was thirty-one, he cares only to re-create his pontito, not the people or events, but the houses, the masonry, the stones, and he does so continually with microscopic and affecting detail.

the chapter ""prodigies,"" focuses on an autistic artist, stephen wiltshire, whom sacks is determined to befriend and understand.  in this tale, and the concluding tale, ""an anthropologist on mars,"" sacks helps us to penetrate the world of the autistic and see it (at least in my interpretation) as an alternate view of reality, a view with its own strengths and weaknesses, a world that is just as true and valid as the ""normal"" one.  of course severe autism is debilitating in the extreme, and even modest autism can permanently scar and alienate the autistic from society.  yet, perhaps that is society's loss.  i even got the sense, in reading these concluding stories about autism, that perhaps theirs is an evolutionary ""strategy"" trying to emerge, that is, a different way of seeing and dealing with the world that also might work.  i would not be shocked to discover some day that the autistic, with their sometimes extraordinary gifts of memory and concentration, are melded more completely and seamlessly into our usual consciousness, and that humankind is the better for it.  incidentally, the last tale about temple grandin, who is a professor of animal studies at colorado state university, is remarkable because it is about an autistic who is completely integrated into the society, yet remains autistic.  she is the one who says she sometimes feels, because of her different perspective, like ""an anthropologist on mars"" when she views ""normal"" people.  sacks allows us to see why.

bottom line: this is an extraordinary book of insight and scholarship about the human condition, written with grace and a deep sense of humanity, not to be missed

1259,"no one alive today cares that ny had fires in 1741 (unlike the chicago fire of 1871). why did author lepore choose to bring up this terrible racial incident. is she trying to create trouble? be a traitor to her own race? book is well researched i guess

311,"i'll be honest, i don't like fiction books.  but i've got to tell you, a mulligan for bobby jobe has changed my mind.  mr. cullen adds so much detail that the reader comes away with a sense of actually being in touch with the cast of limited characters and the events taking place.  the twists and unpredictable turns make the book a truly unforgettable experience.  you don't need to be a golfer or a fan of golf to enjoy this novel.  can lightning strike twice?  absolutely

345,"after getting and reading primary target as a gift, i immediately began picking up other joe weber books.  defcon one, his first, was absolutely terrific.  great plot line and characters.  the action is continuous throughout.  my suggestion is not to pick up this book to read up before going to bed because you'll never put it down.  looking forward to reading his next - shadow flight.  my hat's off to joe weber.  keep up the great work

103,"what a great upbeat book that still covers the struggles of a child of a divorced family, living in poverty, and being of a mixed race.  great great read with a great ending that wasn't to unbelievable.  it left you with a good feeling even though the struggles of the children were very real.  great life lessons as well as cultural lessons in this book

"
1028,"it took two people to write this book? i was pleased to see a chick lit book for the 40-something reader but this book really was a waste of my time. you can see the ending a mile away, for one, but that didn't really bother me. it was the writing. the main character suffers from a syndrome that's unfortunately common to chick-lit heroines, which is to speak in an overly quippy, aren't-i-clever with my snappy dialog way. nearly every one of her sentences included a quip/joke (or a quippy thought in her head as she spoke). real people just don't talk that way, and it makes it impossible to relate to or care about her. by the way, my copy had the first chapter of these authors' next book attached at the end, and they've basically created the same two main characters: the quippy single mom and her ridiculously glamorous best friend. i won't bother with it
"
1308,"i didn't know why i chose to read this book. anyway, it was disappointing, really. the book was slow, and it was too long for a story of its type. i mean, i think the book could go on without some of the parts. when i was reading it, i only thought of putting it down because it's making me go crazy. i thought the plot was shallow, but taylor's self-conflict was even shallower. he kept on blaming himself about his father's death well then it's really his fault! he was a coward. if you don't believe me, go on and read about it... although you might get bored getting to that part because it's towards the end. and i hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with denise. he was acting really immature! he should have at least thought about denise but he was too selfish. it really sucked.

and yes, i know that this is supposed to be a romance novel... but i kept on looking for that love factor althroughout the book. and what did i find? nothing. oh, what a waste. it's like sparks tried very hard to make the situations in the story seem romantic but as a reader, it didn't really capture the whole essence of what romantic situations should be like.

if it hadn't been for my hrr (home reading report) i wouldn't have finished reading this at all.

i guess i'm saying this because i'm not into this genre. love stories are fine but this one... nah

"
546,"having just spent the last few months reading all five books in the three musketeer series, the following are my suggestions.

1.  read all five books in order.  the man in the iron mask is probably enjoyable on its own but reading the four books that proceed it help place the story in its proper context.  think of the man in the iron mask as the dessert in a five course meal.  dessert is great but the four proceeding course are also enjoyable.  getting to the end of the book was especially enjoyable knowing that i was finishing a 3,500 page experience.

2.  read the oxford university editions.  there are wonderful end notes that help the reader keep track of the characters and events.  when you read 3,500 pages you need that type of assistance to keep things straight.  the introductions are also very well written and help the reader get back into focus before beginning the next chapter.

3.  if you really like any one book in particular, go to the internet and purchase a well illustrated used hardback edition for your collection.  i purchased a used three musketeers with illustrations by maurice leloir.  the three hundred plus illustrations make that edition especially enjoyable.

along with sir walter scott, alexandre dumas created the genre of the historical adventure novel.  i have been reading these types of novels my entire life.  beyond a doubt, alexandre dumas is the master virtuoso of this genre.  
"
911,"shakespeare's life is frustratingly beyond our sight. aside from the plays (which, in many cases, come down to us in different versions), we have a slim scattering of legal documents, marriage and birth records, and vague secondary accounts. 

as the world's preeminent shakespeare scholar, greenblatt has managed to assemble all these sources and, with a healthy dose of conjecture, arrive at something resembling a biography of the world's greatest dramatist. more than that, though, this work is a biography of the age in which shakespeare lived and wrote---elizabethan and jacobian london---and how the major events of this time affected shakespeare's plays. for example, the writing of king lear may have been encouraged by a trial in 1603 in which two sisters tried to have their father declared insane so they could take control of his wealth and estate, while the youngest daughter (named cordell) tried to stop them---a story uncannily similar to what is considered to be the bard's greatest tragedy. 

what impressed me the most about this biography is how ordinary shakespeare seemingly was. he didn't seem pretentious or snobbish, as some people envision him. he was born to a humble family and lived frugally, despite dying a rather wealthy man.

although greenblatt's writing is clear and accessible, he makes the assumption that you have already read shakespeare's plays, or at least are very familiar with them. i have read about two thirds of them and felt a little behind when he discussed plays i hadn't read, so if you haven't read more than, say, ten of his plays, the major ones, you need to crack open the norton shakespeare (of which greenblatt is the editor-in-chief) before you approach will in the world.

1014,"this was the first vi warshawski book i ever read, and it did an excellent job of whetting my appetite for more.  i think paretsky did an excellent job of drawing me into vi's world, which is rich with unique characters.  vi comes across as individualistic and principled, and i like how paretsky resisted cliché temptation on several counts: the complex issue of chemical responsibility is not wrapped up in a tidy bundle by the end of the book, and there is no &quot;obligatory sex scene.&quot;  not that sex scenes don't have their places, but i just hate it when i'm reading along and i can almost hear the agent say, &quot;okay, author, you need to steam this up a bit right here if you want to sell this book.&quot;  in this story, vi is all business, which is a delightful change of pace

559,"to learn some italian before visiting italy, i tried multiple language-learning programs borrowed from my local library. some were ridiculous, many required using a workbook.  then i stumbled on the pimsleur program, which is totally audio, allowing me to learn italian while i drove to and from work. due to the pedagogically- sound method pimsleur developed for language learning, i actually did learn some basic italian.  as a result i bought ""conversational italian."" though i've never considered myself adept at language-learning, i actually felt confident in my ablility to learn italian as a result of these cds. i've raved about them to friends who have expressed interest in learning a language

1774,"i'm in love with the impressionists in general and with auguste renoir in particular.
 his palette is full of light; soft pink, greens and blues are a joy to watch time and again. as most impressionists renoir paint wonderful every day scenes, mainly outside as his magnificent: ""the luncheon of the boating party"" (1881), ""the swing"" (1876) and ""le moulin de la galette"" (1876), whose careful reproductions are shown here.
 he was an artist that loved life and wanted to reflect it as he perceived: full of little moments of simple joy and relax.
 he was also a masterful portrayer as you may see from his ""on the terrace"" (1881) in the cover of this book or ""two girls in black"" (1881). 
 another subject that attracted his fancy was the dancing couple, which he depicts with tenderness and accuracy. it doesn't matter if the dancers are from the high class as in ""city dance"" or commoners as in ""dance at bougival"" both from 1883.
 at the end of his life his paintings evolve and produce for our delight: ""seated bather"" (1914) and ""the nymphs"" (1918).
 his life and works are described and commented by the author with keen penetration and endearment.
 reproductions are awesome and do justice to the artist.
 do not miss this book!

806,"the fatalistic view of conservativism is expressed by kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he states, ""[edmund] burke, could he see our century, never would concede that a consumption-society, so near suicide, is the end for which providence has prepared man"".  but wait. the conservative mind was first published in 1953, the mythical golden age of america with ward and june cleaver and normal rockwell. meanwhile, burke, a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century. what a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times.

there are certain ideological threads that carry throughout the book including a belief in the stratification of society. voting should be the privilege of a small minority rather than universal democracy which kirk saw as contributing to a degradation of society. kirk writes, ""what men really are seeking, or ought to seek, is not the right to govern themselves, but the right to be governed well"" but what he offers is a lack of true representation. the author pines for the days of the aristocrat and although he defines the elites by wealth, intellect and lineage he clearly includes race and gender. is it so surprising that kirk lauds some of the worst racists in american history like nathanial bedford forrest whom he describes as `magnificent' before quoting his racist vitriol? in a particularly galling move he referrers to pro-slavery advocate john c. calhoun as a `defender of minorities' and praises john randolph for, among other things, opposing doctrines of racial equality. kirk goes on about calhoun's support for states rights but his support only extended to southern states as he supported the fugitive slave act which forced federal officials and law officials in northern states to return runaway slave under penalty of $1000 fine. he supported laws that would make it illegal for northerners to even protest slavery. for calhoun states rights were nothing more than a self serving attempt to keep slavery safe. kirk shows his own racist stripes when he refers to northern `anti-slavery agitation' and supports calhoun for choosing racial preservation over liberty, although calhoun has an extremely warped view of liberty. one wonders if kirk could even fathom the supreme irony in stating the calhoun mounted a `strong protest against domination by class or region'.

another thread is his desire to see the reunification of church and state. the duty of the church is to keep the unclean masses in line. quoting samuel coleridge, the author makes it clear that the truth or falsity of the church is irrelevant; it is an institution that must be preserved as the primary means of social control. sounding like the inspiration for disgraced chief justice roy moore, russell kirk urges that, ""state and church ought never to be separate entities, true religion is not merely an expression of national spirit; it rises far superior to earthly law, being, indeed, the source of all law"". kirk sees a difference between the faulty laws of man and the laws of god but never draws a distinction. i have to wonder if, like the modern reconstructionist, kirk wanted to see the laws of leviticus imposed including executing homosexuals and blasphemers. he never explains how one might recognize a law of god besides using prejudice.

the third thread would be kirk's anti-intellectual (or perhaps pro-stupid) stance. he refers to human reason as `puny' and `impotent' and claims that we find the mind of god in prejudice and tradition. `prejudice', he writes, `is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved'. actually what he is advocating is for the general population to turn over rational thought to the church and those higher up the social chain. citizens are encouraged to exhibit awe and veneration for god and those in higher stations and authority.

in order to grab the golden fleece of populism conservatives have lately had to abandon overt stratification although veneration of wealth is certainly still evident. like calhoun the support for states rights remains a complete faade. i found russell kirk's salesmanship of conservativism generally repellent but recommend the book because it remains a fairly enlightening view of an ideology that continues to thrive to this day.

1389,"i'd never read berry before, but as far as i can tell, this brief collection of six essays and lectures sticks to familiar territory. however, it's probably not the best entry point for people who are newcomers to his realm. there are two related problems with the book: one of presentation, and one of tone. the problem with presentation is that the pieces are so short that there's no room for specifics. so, while one might be more or less in accord with the broad strokes of berry's vision, there's no detail to back it all up. the problem with tone is that from the very first page the reader feels like they are being lectured at. of course, some of the pieces are lectures, but there's a certain condescension that runs throughout the book. it comes out when berry uses certain words such as the three as of ""appropriate"", ""authentic"" and ""adequate"". when these are used ( as they often are), there he's obviously made some kind of value judgment, but the reader is never let in on it. the end result of the two flaws is that the reader feels like a hectoring argument is being made without any supporting logic -- which ultimately smacks of preaching to the choir.

which is unfortunate, since i tend to agree with berry on a lot of things (though not his anti-abortion stance). small farms are good, agribusiness is bad, stewardship of the land is good, extraction industries are bad, treating the body as an organic whole is good, and things of that nature. alas, he has a tendency of making sweeping assertions and accusations that are far too simplistic and shrill to be useful. two examples from the first 15 pages will suffice to illustrate: ""this is a world in which the cultures that preserve nature and rural life will simply be disallowed."" and ""communists and capitalists are alike in their contempt for country people, country life, and country places."" 

berry also succumbs to the trick of creating straw men to counter his theses. for example, in one essay, he claims that conservationists are people who want to simply preserve land in a pristine, untouched state, and that's all. while there are certainly some conservationists who feel that way, they are a small minority of a a much larger community who actually is in almost total accord with berry's views on stewardship and land use. it certainly doesn't help matters that his view of small-scale farming appears to be heavily tinted with rose-colored glasses. his claims that modern agribusinesses has rendered the small farm economically unviable sounds like a reasonable proposition. however, it ignores the fact that, historically, small scale farming ran on the thinnest of margins, was subject to all kind of external instability (weather, vermin, etc.), and operated on only slightly better than a subsistence level. in farming, cash is scarce, that's why people abandoned it in droves whenever the opportunity presented itself, such as in wwii, when all those defense-industry factories were opened in california. (of course, in berry's vision, you don't really need cash, because you barter for everything you need from your neighbors.) 

berry's exhortations to create small-scale communities is worthy stuff, and even in cities people are creating this. the growth of csas, farmers markets, and the like in the past decade is a tangible indicator of this. however, to achieve the large scale results berry seeks requires a more rigorous roadmap than what is provided in this slim collection

1829,"am i the only one who didn't get a complete book? at first i noticed there was some poor editing - lots of typos. but then after page 180, where page 181 should be (sleep chapter), it goes back to page 117 (discipline chapter that i already read). it continues to repeat pages 117 to 180 (a whole 63 pages duplicated!), then picks up again on page 245 in the middle of the school days chapter that i don't have the beginning of. i'm completely missing pages 181-245 (67 pages).

other than that, good for a few laughs and a handful of ideas

482,"generations of hate come together in this book.  pete braga killed franklin mcmichael dead in a claim of self-defense in the summer of 1952.  the next generation carried on the tradition when gabriel mcmichael supposedly beat pete's son, victor, so severely that he suffered permanent brain damage, rendering him with the iq of a ten-year old.  the third generation was naïve to all this hatred when thomas mcmichael fell in love with pete's granddaughter patricia.  the love of his life was driven away at a young age when grandfather pete refused to permit their love to blossom.  while the mcmichael family existed in near poverety, the braga family thrived in power and money.

so now thomas has a problem.  the root of all his family's hatred, pete braga, has been found dead.  he was murdered by someone at his home.  thomas has been assigned the case to find out who wanted the old man dead.  given his many enemies, the list of suspects is long.  it doesn't help that the first suspect, sally rainwater...pete's personal nurse, becomes the object of thomas' heart as the investigation unravels. 

the story twists and turns through many leads and many unexpected plot points as thomas mcmichael is determined, despite his family's hatred of pete, to find out who is behind the killing and why.  author t. jefferson parker does an excellent job in keeping the reader involved and interested in the story with his enthralling style.

1710,"for a recently college graduate and moderate sports world observer with little experience negotiating in a business environment, this book was a pleasure to read. the concepts in this book are on or above par with my textbook on negotiation. however, i specifically enjoyed how steinberg illustrates important concepts with stories involving the ever interesting personalities of professional sports. from establishing values to finalizing the contract, this book is efficiently organized to lead through the negotiation process. also, at the end of each sub-chapter is a summary of the key points of the reading. winning with integrity isn't easy in general, let alone in the ruthless world of sports agents. leigh shares his experiences that have lead to his success in this fun and insightful book

1042,"if you are looking for a ""feel good"" book about baby boomer retirement, this book may have some value for you. but if you are looking for specific in-depth how-to, this book isn't the answer. each segment-work, dreams, travel-is short and doesn't address many relevant issues.
for example, regarding the work chapter, the author postulates that there will be a work shortage and companies will hire baby boomers to fill the gap. well, that is speculative with globalism. those jobs may be outsourced. most are low paying. many of my highly qualified friends are unable to find jobs despite retraining. yes, there may be wal-mart jobs but is this your retirement dream? the work chapter sounds a lot like most ""do what you love"" books. but doing what you love is often best as a hobby not to furnish needed income. these and other issues facing boomers who want meaningful work into their 70s are not addressed. i could pick apart other chapters in the same manner

1713,"great book; it get's you thinking. my kids arre almost out of the nest and they are all i could ask for. yes, i worked. but not until they were in school, almost always part time and i did not use 'working' as an excuse to not volunteer at school, sports, and generally be in my kids lives. the point is really about your priorities. do you instinctively put your kids needs first? it's been interesting to see how things have worked out with families in our area. we have a large group of kids who have been together since kindergarten; now they are seniors. you can instantly tell which parents were connected, involved and had their priorities straight. not all of them stayed home the whole time. 
on and off i used to listen to dr. laura, frequently agreeing, but many times not. what i love is that she has an unpopular point of view and she's not going to let social, financial, or industry pressure dilute her message. yes, she's frequently abrasive; so were many people who have made an impact in the course of events in this world. if you are a parent with young children read the book at least it will give you important ideas to agree or disagree with.

303,"this book has major shortcomings; stein's obsession with character over plot, for one (martin amis said, ""i used to sneer at plot until i wrote a novel that had one, titled night train. it was hard and i used stay awake at night hoping i wasn't leaving any holes.""), another being his obsession with ""show don't tell"" (gabriel garcia marquez's novel love in the time of cholera is probably the greatest novel of the 1980's and it's almost entirely ""tell"" and very little ""show."") and the passages stein includes from his own novels as examples of good writing were actually examples of terrible writing! (a taxi ""disengorging"" its passengers is categorically bad writing.) and stein admits he rejected frederick forythe's the day of the jackal. i wouldn't read a book by dick rowe about how to make it in the music business (rowe famously rejected the beatles from decca records). stein excuses himself that he was going by only an outline, but then rowe was going by just a demo tape. better writing books are out there
"
979,"i was assigned this book for a college course and was greatly surprised at its quality.  blamires had c.s. lewis as a tutor, and i've read some of lewis's writings and have found them to be above average but not particularly special (many people do find his works special of course).  blamires, on the other hand, i find to be very unique - his book is top quality and very helpful.  i'm surprised this isn't a very popular book, as it ought to be.

i have only two complaints, both of which are purely stylistic.  first, the edition i have looks like it's a copy of an earlier edition, which makes the text hard to read (i got used to it after a while though).  some publisher should take it upon themself to retype this book and republish it.  my second criticism is something that can't be avoided - the book was originally written in the early sixties, so a lot of the examples are dated (i.e. references to wwii, which was still in memory, also out-of-date terms like ""jive"", etc.).  however, just a few of the examples are affected by this.  the book as a whole could be reasonably passed off today as a recent work, since so much blamires's criticism of the christian mind (or lack thereof) still (sadly) applies.

however, the christian mind today is being rediscovered, and the march of atheism is on the decline, with the march of religion in general on the rise.  even though things are looking up, christians should keep blamires's book in mind - not to get too comfortable with this (secular) world, for our real home is beyond bodily death.  that we ought to have a supernatural orientation is basically the theme and summary of this book.

superb book, and i really recommend this to anyone.  this is definitely recommended for christians, and also for any non-christian who are curious and want to take a look at some of the problems christians have today

1110,"the theory behind this important collection of essays is that &quot;the history of medieval power is to be sought in microcosms.&quot; these essays demonstrate quite effectively that it can be found there as well.  each  essay focuses on a facet of the shifting power relationships in twelfth and  thirteenth century europe.  at issue in each are the questions of what or  who held the power to command or punish, and how that power was obtained,  kept and manifested.  this is a truly enlightening book. of particular  interest are the essays on holding power over the truth, as well as those  dealing the formation of the nobility into a self-consciously chivalric  warrior class.  however, all the essays are intelligent and useful  explorations into the very nature and meaning of power.  ultimately, this  book must be considered essential for any serious student of history,  casual or academic

"
41,"this book is terribly organized.  i'm not sure what happened in writing this book, but it seems clear that professor jones did not compile this in the chronological order that it is printed in.

my main complaint is that rather obscure concepts/people/events are repeatedly referred to, and then only later does jones bother to define them.  (i would almost prefer that he not define something at all, rather than offering a definition 100 pages after his first reference to it!)  the fact that the book has an index only further infuriated me - clearly the author/publisher knew where all these terms were located throughout the book, yet did not bother to offer a definition in the appropriate/first reference to the concept.

examples are numerous, but here are a few:
**robe nobility: referenced on pages 139, 152, 183.  defined? (pg. 183)
**sans culottes: first referenced on page 189, defined on page 231.
**louis-sebastien mercier: referenced on pages 11, 138, 178, 189, 200, 204, 212, 213.  when did jones provide information (that he was a ""journalist, dramatist and observer of parisian mores"") on just who mercier is?  page 215.

aside from that, there are some plain old errors.  one such is in the text box on saint genevieve.  jones mentions that she negotiated with frankish military chieftains in the 570s and 580s.  she died in 512ad, so the negotiations seem improbable.  (470s & 480s would be correct, but i should not have to figure that out.)

the redeeming quality of the book is that if does offer information on paris if you are willing to sift through the above mentioned annoyances.  and paris is not such a bad subject

45,"more than anything else alan furst recreates the atmosphere of the early days of world war ii espionage. i.a. serebin inhabits the urbane world of russian emigres in the europe of 1940-1941, mainly in paris, but also in roumania. serebin is recruited into what seems to be the british secret service and seeks to interrupt the flow of roumanian oil to the nazi war machine. the whole operation reeks of amateurism - appropriate enough at that stage of the war - brainy, careful, daring, but amateur. with one exception, none of the players know completely what they are part of - which also leaves the reader at times groping for the story line. still furst's prose forms the characters into full-dimensional beings from bogart's casablanca or graham greene's human factor. 

highly recommended for readers with an interest in espionage or ww ii
"
1108,"""the great locomotive chase"" is the stuff of legend.  this somewhat obscure event, which commemorated the first anniversary of the first shots on fort sumter, could too easily be written off among civil war devotees as a lark, a foolhardy distraction from the inexorable march from shiloh to the seven days, to second manassas, to the three more years of bloodletting that were required in order to form a more perfect union.  but first-time author russell bonds does a masterful job of taking this adventure story on its own terms, telling it well, and placing it in its proper context.  the raid itself is a gripping story of intrigue, espionage, and derring-do.  and if mr. bonds had only told the tale itself, this book would be well worth the read.  but what sets this distinguished this book apart from so much civil war writing is mr. bonds's ability to tell this gripping tale objectively, while putting it in its proper context.  the author sets the table with a relatively brief yet thorough overview of the strategic arrangement of the war nine months after first manassas.  and by doing so, and by explaining why the raid, coupled with the deep penetration of general ormsby mitchell into tennessee and north alabama, offered the fleeting chance to cut the confederacy in two and thereby hasten the end of the war, mr. bonds gives the otherwise reckless ï¿½lan of the raiders its proper place.  andrews and his raiders were not off on a lark, even though students of the era will have the natural reaction, ""what were they thinking?""  mr. bonds answers that question, and the answer, as incongruous as it may seem, reminds the reader that there was so much more to the great war than the epic battles of the armies of the potomac and northern virginia.  

if the author had done nothing more than told the story of the great raid, reconciling contemporary accounts that were so often embellished, this would be a wonderful adventure story, in the great tradition of shelby foote's narrative history of the war.  but this book does so much more.  it puts the raid in its proper strategic context, and it tells the story of the gallant raiders after the raid itself failed.  this book will satisfy both the devoted civil war critic and the general reader who loves a historical tale well-told.

"
761,"horror master arthur machen's crowning achievement, a still shocking compendium of interwoven short horror tales.   in late 19th century london, a scientist and an unpublished writer join forces as amateur detectives in an attempt to solve a minor but puzzling mystery which ultimately leads to the discovery of a truly diabolical conspiracy.  in the course of their investigations, the two men find themselves repeatedly surrendering their attention to a series of seemingly outlandish tales spun by an assortment of eccentric story tellers.  the stories, which all deal with imposture of some kind, are only tangentially related to each other, yet offer the somewhat bumbling sleuths important clues to the mystery at hand.  machen builds suspense slowly and methodically, masterfully leading the reader on to a completely unexpected, gruesome climax.  comical, tragic, sophisticated, violent, horrific, and even downright disgusting, the three impostors is a classic horror novel of sly deception and wit.    

the 1995 everyman paperback is the only critical edition of this remarkably rich book released to date, offering a scholarly introduction (by editor david trotter) that carefully details machen's main influences (chiefly robert louis stevenson) and themes (imposture of various kinds, also derived from stevenson).  a short text summary nicely encapsulates the narrative's various twists and turns.  finally, a section entitled ""machen and his critics"" provides a welcome offering of mostly contemporaneous critical responses to this remarkable book; while many of these reviews were laudatory, quite a few passionately outraged quotes reveal just how shocking the three impostors must truly have been in its time

625,"this story should have and could have been really good. it presents a great concept, but the story is just so poorly crafted. it is very sexist, the prose is stiff, and the plot is dull. i will concede that it was interesting at times; it kept me reading, but i really didn't get much out of it. i can only praise heinlein for including the ""intelligent conversation"" which takes place after the press conference, where there is a great explantion on why the english language is so difficult to learn. the whole story is just very odd. do read it though. it's a title to read if you wish to be considered ""well read."" despite its faults, valentine michael smith will be a character in literature that will never be forgotten, just as we will never forget atticus from ""to kill a mockingbird.""

1925,"this was a required text for one of my graduate courses and i didn't expect to enjoy it much. it wasn't far into the book that i began to resonate with some of the struggles for racial harmony articulated by perkins and rice. 

in chapter 1, spencer perkins states emphatically, ""the civil rights movement has run its course, and we've gotten just about all you can expect to get from a political movement."" i, a white guy, took offense at the thought that someone would declare the struggle for civil rights obsolete. his point is well made through the development of this and subsequent chapters. the move toward reconciliation must move from race to grace. 

regardless of your religious affiliations, if you are engaged in civil rights causes or racial reconciliation you would be remiss to neglect this ground-breaking tome.

1805,"...if you're in the bathroom with time on your hands! i must admit that i did finish this book and was glad that the ordeal was over.  puzo (like leon uris) definitely lost the touch near the end of his career and this book is no exception.  in just a few hundred pages, president kennedy ii is shown as a tyrant, a socialist, a reactionary, a humanitarian, a political bumbler, a visionary of usa utopia, a man who would kill a few thousand citizens to save himself from impeachment, a liar who can beat the ultimate lie detector, a dear and loving husband/father, etc....how many characters must one man be?  and what's this odd sub-plot of a former-mormon/hollywood oddball who on a whim (in less than 10 seconds of consideration when the opportunity presents itself) decides to kill the president of the united states.  once again another character with fourteen different personalities!.  puzo even got his basic facts wrong about the mormons (he should have stuck with the catholic church). i would hate to be washed up on a deserted island and find this book washed up on the shore next to me! i would go crazy reading it again

1105,"now, i enjoy victorian adventure fiction as much as the next person -- in fact, probably more than the next person, since the average ""next person"" hasn't ever read any. tales of derring-do, adventures to unexplored distant lands, lost civilizations, great artifacts, etc. -- that's all good stuff. what's not good is this book, which is tedious in the extreme. on the surface of it, haggard's followup to his hugely successful (and infinitely better) ""king solomon's mines"" has all the elements: a dynamic duo of scholar-adventurers (one of whom is descended from pharaohs!), a mysterious message from the past delivered by a dying man, an expedition to africa, and a supernatural being who knows the secret of eternal life.

however, despite this promising laundry list, haggard's execution leaves a great deal to be desired. a friend described it rather aptly as ""a book with a lot of story, but not a lot of plot."" which is to say that in my edition, some 320 pages are filled without much happening. there is the initial mysterious set-up, the journey to dark africa with the usual physical trials and tribulations, the heroes' conveyance to the ""lost city"", and then... and then things kind of grind to a halt. lengthy descriptive details, lengthy internal ruminations, lengthy rambling speeches, lengthy everything -- but very little of consequence occurs until the very end, when the heroes make a dangerous journey to find the eternal fire which grants nigh-everlasting life.

i suspect much of the problem stems from the book's origin as a long-running serial in the gazette. as i understand it, serial writers of the time were paid by the word or by the installment, and thus, it was to their advantage to spin their plots out as much possible -- hence the unhealthy ratio of action to words. judicious editing could reduce the book to 1/3 of its size without any loss of note. of course, as another friend pointed out, it's probably best to read the book is small chunks -- just as one would have done with installments. spreading out one's reading of it over a period of time, he suggests, may serve to conceal the book's rambling nature. in any event, there are some nice scenes here and there, such as the moonlight battle between crocodile and lion and another involving human cadavers used as torches, but those are about all i'm likely to recall from this book in a year. 

of course, as is noted in the introduction to my edition, haggard lifted the main elements of the plot, and even the the true name of ""she-who-must-not-be-named"", from several earlier adventure novels by edward bulwer-lytton, so one can't even give him much credit for imagination. i suppose the book is worth reading by those interested in literary representations of the prevailing xenophobic sentiments of victorian englishmen: racism, anti-semeticism, misogyny, fear of miscegenation, etc., but as entertainment for the modern reader, it falls woefully short of the mark.
"
924,"i love mysteries set in ww ii and like old time radio so i couldn't wait to begin this one. the ""hero"" is a junior varsity tom joad but,ok, i was game.  the cast of characters that seemed to number in the low 80s and be interchangable ""baddies"" and ""goodies"".  they were hard to keep track of without a scorecard but there is no quit in this reader and i pushed on. then when we got to the jersey shore, i found out that in 1942 with america fighting for it's life against fascism, and losing, our hero knew why.  all the servicemen were bullies (a drafted station employee) or morons (the coast guard beach patrol).  the 4f ""hero"" was the real mccoy however.  although not actually mentioned i bet he wished that dratted ear injury hadn't kept him from joining the abraham lincoln brigade.  he was moderate enought to think marxism had some problems; the murder of 10s of millions of ukrainians and the nazi-ussr pact probably and i say probably, didn't elude our observant literary genius.  he was also a 1975 era feminist; all those plucky ww ii women throwing off the handcuffs chaining them naked to the kitchen sink had his unhesitating support.  most big businessmen, probably wearing spats and silk high hats, were the bad guys needless to say.  i wondered how someone could write such a truly awful book.  i couldn't finish it and it's a point of honor for me to finish all books.  then in the bio it all became clear.  the author was a flack for former congresswoman pat schroeder of colorado.  i'm still haunted by her rictus grin and constipated, quaker schoolmarm expression that said ""somebody, somewhere is having fun and i want it to stop now!!!""  anyone who could stand to work for pat could write this book with ease

490,"arrogance by bernard goldberg is a truly enjoyable read.  goldberg doesn't waste time trying to create a vast left wing conspiracy tied to islam or communism, he just presents the facts as he sees them.  as a former insider, he's got the dirt on media bigwigs, and he's not afraid to dish.  the liberal bias in the news is causing many people to flee the big three networks and turn on cable to find an escape.  goldberg offers up several examples of this bias and then goes further by coming up with several suggestions (some tongue in cheek) for correcting this slant.  he also includes surprisingly frank interviews with tim russert and bob costas.  goldberg's other books bias and 100 people who are screwing up america are also excellent reads.  he doesn't attack people on a personal level (although you can tell he has a bit of a grudge against dan rather) or use hyperbole or vitriol to get his point across.  some books written with a conservative slant make you want to throw up your hands and give up on this country, but goldberg's books don't have that effect.  you can tell he not only loves the country he lives in, but also the profession that he's chosen, and he has hope for the future.

robert has done an amazing job in correlating the life of the buddha with the tarot journey through the cards. he describes how the major arcana fits perfectly with the life of siddhartha and his journey of enlightenment. each of the tarot trumps is a stage on the mystic's journey to enlightenment. in fact, it is mr. place's belief that the creators of the tarot were directly influenced by the life of the buddha, and incorporated archetypes into the major arcana based on his journey. he teaches that the ancient wisdoms were not isolated from one another. instead, ""the classical world maintained communications with india and the ancient western philosophers were familar with indian philosophies."" as well, the islamic world introduced the christians to the life of the buddha during the middle ages. ""the european christians were enamored with the story, and they transformed him into a christian saint - st. josaphat."" 

i was fascinated by the titles given to the major arcana cards. each of the 23 cards reflect an important aspect of the siddhartha's personal journey to become the enlightened one, the buddha.

robert place has created a deck and book that not only meets the needs of people who practice eastern beliefs. he also acts as a mediator to help people of the western world learn about and appreciate the noble tenets of buddhism and its teachings for life. i highly recommend this deck - i found it very easy to follow, the graphics are amazingly detailed and artistically rendered and the companion book clearly helps you to learn to ""read"" using a buddhist world view.

455,"this book was fun to look at, but not really usable. lots of stylized drawings and self-aggrandizing tales by the author and not a lot of realistic how-to. also, the explanations about skin care were clearly not written by anyone with a science or medical background.
"
1267,"this book is so awesome!!! it has so much great info in it. it is a book that is so easy to read before you know it your done. it makes you really think about your relationship prior affair and after affair. what went wrong and were it went wrong at. it offers so many was to open up communication and how to talk to one another without fighting. there isnt enough things to say how awesome this book is. must have for anyone in a bad situation. it has a questionnaire at the end that both partners can do and an agreement for both partners to read and sign. it helps lift your spirit and makes you think that this isnt the end of the world and that you can make it through. i have a new found hope for my marriage and a new attitude towards everything. i am looking at the bigger picture and the brighter side of things. i am alive and i still have my family and my husband. we go to thearpy and with all the great info in this book just put what we have learned into action and hopefully great results will be the outcome. get this book you wont regret it!!!

1038,"theodore b. taylor, the physicist who was the subject of this book died in 2004, but not before he had completed his spiritual journey from nuclear bomb maker to nuclear protester.  even though the text of this book originally appeared in ""the new yorker"" in 1973, taylor was still driven to publish his own works on the dangers of nuclear proliferation.  mcphee has a very understated style (""just the facts, ma'am""), but this book is still the most frightening i've ever read.  i can't decide whether i would want him to write a sequel, because the threat of a nuclear bomb explosion is even greater today than it was in 1973.  just ask yourself the following questions:

is there more plutonium available to terrorists in 2006 than there was in 1973?  yes.

do more nations have nuclear capability?  yes.

can a nuclear bomb be built that is even smaller and more efficient than its 1973 counterpart?  yes.

are the instructions for building a nuclear device more readily available than they were in 1973?  yes.

do some people hate america even more than they did in 1973?  decide this one for yourself.

john mcphee, staff writer for the ""new yorker"" and pulitzer-prize-winning author of twenty-seven books on subjects as various as oranges and the merchant marine, has written a nuclear explosion of a book in ""the curve of binding energy.""    it's one of those books that is even more relevant now than when it was written.  essentially, it's a blueprint of how to build a nuclear device using materials at hand, along with a chunk of rather easily stolen u-235 or plutonium.  theodore b. taylor, himself the creator of smaller, more efficient nuclear bombs, tells us where to steal the plutonium, how to assemble a bomb, even gives hints on where to plant it--one of the eeriest parts of this book has taylor and mcphee exploring the now-vanished towers of the world trade center, trying to pick the spot where a nuclear device could do the most damage.

""the curve of binding energy"" is a must read for every man, jack, and paper-pusher in the department of homeland security, not to mention both houses of congress.  i imagine the first reaction of many congresspersons would be to ban this book, but it's way too late for that, my friend.

1489,"i bought this book, the paperback version. the text is good, it describes all his letters and tries to do a lot of explanations too. however the prints of his paintings are not that impressive.  they are very dark prints. go for some other book if you want to see the corect colors of his paintings
"
1643,"yes, it's the bible of cooking.  its like a degree at the culinary institute.  however, its not an easy book to cook from.  most recipes refer to several parts of the book for details on how to prepare different parts of the recipe.  so you contstantly have to page back and forth in the book.  its intimidating for the novice who just wants to cook, but if you really want to learn about cooking then its the book to have
"
371,"this book explains very well the growing paranoia of modern parents. this is a resolute attack against parenting determinism. it is regrettable, however, that the author's references are not more ""scientific"" than those he reproaches to parenting determinism advocates of using. moreover, he is not far from praising spanking, which is ""proven"" very bad for children

908,"patriotic terrorist fighting storyline.  exposes the political games played in washington, that many times put our military in dangerous situations.  this book inspires me to patriotism and also deep gratitude to the special forces men who are so brave.  i know the book is fiction, but i can't help but feel that it is more truth than fiction.  mitch rapp's wife anna is getting a little hard to stomach.  she is a good example of how an aggressive woman can nearly neuter a strong man. again, hard to recommend to absolutely everyone because of the explicit sexual situations.  i hate to encourage my teenage boys to read it, although 95% is absolutely wonderful and inspiring, portraying men as real men.

"
1282,"this is, without question, the worst book ever written on one's financial life.  to begin with, it's useless: zero information, zero new analysis of old information, zero advice, zero interesting anecdotes.  additionally, it's rambling--meandering from summaries of old data, to poorly written schmaltzy 'new age' feel-good blathering.  what exactly is this guy's point?   no way to tell. 
seriously, this book is so bad that all the people who allowed their names to be associated with blurbs on the cover have, in my opinion, lost all remaining credibility.  
what a waste of my $16 and 4 hours. 
i want my money and time back.
"
3,"the book contained more profanity than i expected to read in a book by rita rudner.  i had expected more humor from a comedienne.  too bad, because i really like her humor
"
336,"great story!!  excellent in fact.  my beef is with the narrator and editor:

as someone who grew up in the baltimore area, i thoroughly enjoyed the local references.  however, it is frustrating to hear the narrator mispronounce baltimore icons, like boog's bbq at camden yards.  for the record, it is not pronounced bow-g!  it is boo-g... do better research!!
"
1867,"i am so passionate about this book.  it has answered all the life questions i have ever held.  although many people i have recommended it to have reported that they have not been able to ""get into it"" - for me, i would say it is the best book i have ever read.  
this is about the 5th copy i have purchased because when i lend it out, somehow it is not returned and i want to have a copy to re-read every now and then.  (i will not be lending this one again
"
745,"sometimes a reader knows more about a narrow subject than the author. when the author is in error about that subject, the reader may question the accuracy of the descriptions in the rest of the book. such is the case here.

i've written 123 books; several on parachutes and skydiving. i am a pilot, skydiver and parachute rigger; i know the sport and the industry. 

the author wrote:

""we use flat chutes as parasails."" 
what is ""flat""? square? rectangular? ram-air?
a ""parasail"" is a kite and is usually under tow behind a boat. this sentence does not make any sense.

""four miles up, he pulled"". that would be 21,120 feet. 
the use of oxygen is not mentioned.

""ferocious, out of control spiral. one of the cells collapsed."" 
the collapse of a single cell will not cause a fast turn and the cell is easily re-inflated.

""corkscrewing caused the other cells to collapse."" 
not likely.

""guide lines""
an uncommon reference. they are referred to as control lines or toggles. 

he jettisoned the main canopy at 15,000 feet. he freefell ten seconds and opened his reserve at 12,700 feet. the rest of the team on this haho jump would still be at 18,000 feet. 
""five minutes later."" he would be at about 8,000 feet.
""he estimated he had about 15 minutes of glide remaining.""
more like eight minutes.

 ""he was so relaxed, he was startled to hear canopies fluttering all around him and the sound of men splashing down just under him.""
how did they all beat him to the landing area? they were 5,000 feet above him. 

fiction writers have a responsibility to make their descriptions accurate.
when a reader finds obvious discrepancies in one area, it makes him or her wonder if the rest of the book is accurate.

and, the writing is not creative.

640,"this is a terrific cookbook, even for people like me who are not trained bakers. i have succeeded in making three recipes already--they work great. have a long way to go to try a lot of other really inviting recipes. her book also serves as a great reference for anything chocolate. 

i was quite impressed with the fact that ms. lonbotham pays an historical homage to chocolate decadence (page 42) as being a seminal contribution to chocolate lovers worldwide. living in berkeley at the time, i well remember what a sensatation it caused.
"
1163,"it's disturbing to see how many mistakes i found just browsing through this colorful, attractive book.  though the state bird of alabama is known locally as ""yellowhammer,"" you will not find that name in any field guide!  the accompanying picture was no help either in identifying what turned out to be the common flicker. other state birds were listed by uncommon, incorrect, misleading names too.
the 1995 bombing in oklahoma city is represented by a nice picture and writeup, but with a glaring misspelling in its headline--""in memorium"" should be ""in memoriam.""  
claremore, ok is misspelled as ""clarmore"" on the map.
these errors leaped out at me just flipping through the pages.  this is very disappointing and makes me wonder what other misinformation this book contains.  adults have some knowledge and experience against which to measure what they read; schoolchildren who may be learning facts for the first time need the facts to be correct

743,"save your time, money and patience.  this may be the worst book i have read since the equally monotonous, predictable stone barrington novel ""the short forever"".  wow, this one stinks.  like others, i put up with the shallow characters, ludicrous dialogue and endless parade of showers, boobs and guns to figure out whodunit.  unfortunately, this book had an ambiguous ending that seeks to be clever but is instead is just stupid.  who on earth did kill vance?  and come to think of it, who gives a damn?  i don't what women did to stuart woods but he sure seems to hold them in complete contempt.  every female character, save for isabel the maid, felt compelled to practically rape our handsome hero.  each is flawless and gorgeous but also all are dumb, vacuous, self-centered and thoroughly unlikeable - hey a couple are even truly psychotic!  the only normal female character who spared stone, mary ann, unfortunately has a room temperature iq.  i am hardly a prude, but i lost count of how many women either vance or stone made love to in the course of one short novel and felt the need to take a long hot shower to rid myself of the feelings of filth.  mr. woods either lives in a world of complete ignorance or the reading public is a lot less discriminating than i thought

1219,"i was raised in virginia and never understood the details of the battle of yorktown. now i see the big picture and how all the regional events in the glorious cause fit together. immediately after finishing this book i returned to yorktown with an entirely different understanding. i could relive the battle as if i had been there during the war. it was fascinating! i never learned this from history books.

1826,"this book is as close to perfect as you can get. i personally like magical realism and also wanted to learn more about the recent history of india.

worth noting, the mistry book, a fine balance, while good, is basically a full on rip off of this book. if you want the original, read rushdie. mistry should be ashamed. his is not even a different take, it is just another take of the same image and not as good

293," there are just too many errors ,of interpretation,omission and commission,in this book to justify purchasing it.in this review we will concentrate on rima's(r)handling of the work of j m keynes.on p.84,r's claim that the physiocratic concept of hoarding is &quot;surprisingly suggestive&quot; of j m keynes's idea has no supporting evidence to back it up.on p.133,r claims that malthus had developed a principle of effective demand,a la keynes.what malthus expressed was an uneasy feeling and/or intuition that ricardo's deductive,analytical system of market self adjustment to a global optimum was overlooking(or assuming away)the possibility of insufficient aggregate spending.nowhere does malthus ever systematically present a theoretical counter to ricardo.what malthus does is express some reservations in an exchange of postal letters with ricardo.in chapter 20 of r's book, she attempts to deal with keynes's theory of effective demand and keynes's discussion of involuntary unemployment which follows directly from his theory.keynes worked out the mathematical details in his chapter 20,titled &quot;the employment function&quot;.r should have simply reprinted that chapter in her book,replacing her chapter 20 with keynes's chapter 20.r's figure 20.1,discussed on pages451-454,directly contradicts keynes's analysis

1776,"i assume the plot of this famous tale is well known, so i won't spend time on it, but in recently re-reading this book for the first time since ninth-grade english class in the '90's, i was repeatedly struck by a piercing question: how exactly over time does drama become melodrama? will our cherished novels seem melodramatic to readers a hundred-forty years hence? how does this happen, and is there ever an end-point to it? dickens was by any standard a literary master, and if typifying one's age is a virtue, then he does this to perfection, yet if failing to achieve a universality unhindered by time (as other writers have done) is a limitation, then in this one sense alone charles dickens has an achilles heel
"
1586,"this book was given to me by my cousin who thought i might find faith after hearing the eulogy i gave at my father's funeral a year ago, in which i professed that i do not know if there is a god or not, but that the best we can do is be good people.

i am agnostic, in that i am fully aware that there is no factual evidence that god exists and that there is no evidence that god does not exist. to be clear - if there was, i am pretty sure it would be widely publicized.

the gift was a loving gesture and i am sincerely appreciative of it.

however, i have several issues with the book. more than i can possibly iterate at this point.

this book does not even mention agnosticism. as the author was educated at yale, i am sure he must be aware of agnosticism and chose to omit it from his book. i can only presume that it was omitted with a reason, perhaps it was too hard to explain in the face of his assertion that there is evidence for god (see below - all circumstantial and requiring leaps of faith).

without getting into too many specifics, the evidence he uses in the case for faith comes from obviously christian sources - which are surely biased. this is equivalent to reporting on terrorist acts by only interviewing terrorists. certainly one's reporting would be validating reasons for such atrocities. to be clear i am only drawing this distinction to make the point - a true investigative reporter would look to include both sides of the story and present facts as opposed to opinion. had strobel intended to provide a balanced view, he would have used non-christian scientists and believers of various faiths.

strobel's statements portend to be fact, but are generally lacking any actual evidence and in some cases are easily determined to be incorrect. 

a couple of examples are 

1) his statement that buddhism says there is no god (various sects of buddhism believe in gods, state there is no creator god or do not take a stand on the matter) and 

2) his statements on lack of evidence for evolution - specifically macroevolution (which is fairly well supported by actual evidence and observation - and believed to be accurate by 99% of biologists). 
 
regarding evolution, there is actually evidence for macroevolution - although he claims there is none. this is where i have serious problems with the book. in my opinion, the book is more for current believers who need/desire to strengthen their faith, which i believe is a good thing. however, his information lacks factual support and evidence, which to me is a bad thing. i believe that most of the people who would read it would not get to the point of questioning the information in it. if one were to question it, one could easily find their faith destroyed if the information one held to be true (and which subsequently was the basis for faith) is found to be false. 

he states that there is evidence for intelligent design; however the evidence he offers is only theory in the colloquial sense - i.e. a guess. the theory of evolution is a theory in the scientific sense - i.e. supported by on observation and evidence.

another example is when strobel quotes ""...when it comes right down to it, the only person or thing i know of worth my faith - the only one supported by the evidence of history and archaeology and literature and experience - is jesus."" 

the buddha (meaning one who is awake), or   siddhartha gautama (his real name), was an actual person, supported by all of the above listed proof of jesus. mohammad was also an actual person supported by all of the above. 

his 3 reasons for disbelief in reincarnation (for regular people):
 
1) if james loses 3 pounds, he is still james, if he becomes a grasshopper he is not james - because he is not human
2) support for past lives - such as memories, are explainable by psychological explanations, lucky guesses, or demonic possession
3) the only expert on this question, jesus of nazareth, said it doesn't happen. 

to respond:

1)	to believe in resurrection, one must believe that there is a substance which makes us who we are that is not tied to our earthly form. it is not tied to being human, but to existing.
2)	how do you discount the possibility that reincarnation exists by asserting that demon possession exists - there is factual evidence for neither.
3)	to be in line with this reason, one must already accept the divinity of jesus and that the resurrection actually happened. 

his arguments for the truth of the resurrection (below) are weak and offer no support for the fact, only that people claimed it happened. we should not confuse the fact that jesus existed with the belief that he was the son of god and specifically that he was reincarnated.
 
here are his proof that god exists: 
1)	god makes sense of the universe's origin
2)	god makes sense of the universe's complexity
3)	god makes sense of moral values (his argument is - if there are absolute moral values then god must exists god makes sense of the resurrection (see proof below).
4)	god can be immediately experienced.
 
to respond:

1)	theories can be used to explain phenomenon that correlate to reality, but are not truly an explanation of reality. one still must take a leap of faith to believe his assertion. while it may explain questions about the universe - how do we know it to be accurate? put another way, there are other explanations that could wrap up the universe - additionally, one presumes he is speaking of the christian god and discounting other belief systems.
2)	see my first objection. same point.
3)	science believes in hard observable facts being the basis for making assertions. the basis of scientific fact is that it is able to be recreated by anyone. to take the leap from the fact that there are widely accepted truths to being proof of god requires faith. he gives examples of ideas that most of the civilized world thinks are wrong, and uses them as the basis for absolute moral values. he omits that moral values have changed over time and are evolving. while i do believe that things are wrong, one can easily recognize that they are not always absolute...for example, it is not ok to kill, unless you are in danger - or the other person killed others (presuming you believe in capital punishment).
4)	his example here is that you cannot prove the world exists...fair enough, but one can prove there are universally experienced events that we can demonstrate over and over again. for example, we can do a physics experiment and everyone involved will see the same results (barring psychological conditions). while we may not be able to prove that the world exists, we can confirm common experience, which is essentially what the world is...the ground on which we all interact - whether or not that is created in the mind (the example he gives for how the world may not exist is that all of the world may only be in our mind).

proof jesus was resurrected:
 
1)	the location of jesus' burial was widely known and agreed on.
2)	the sunday after his crucifixion the tomb was empty, which is agreed upon by many (or all).
3)	various groups of people experienced appearances of jesus alive again.
4)	the original disciples suddenly and sincerely believe that jesus was risen from the dead - even enough to die for this belief.
 
 to respond:
1)	this is fact and jesus did exist. not sure how it relates to his divinity.
2)	this could be explained in several ways, hard to use this as proof of his divinity. one can suppose it is, but it takes a leap of faith - this book is supposed to explain how to have faith - but continually requests we make leaps of faith.
3)	writings of people who claims to experience jesus can hardly be taken as fact. other religious text would claim the same about their prophets, gods, etc. 
4)	the disciples had a vested interest in proclaiming the divinity of jesus. this is not actual evidence. this is equivalent to stating that the bible is true because it says it is true.

additionally, strobel chooses which parts of the bible are literal and which are metaphorical. in dealing with ""objection 5"" strobel notes that the descriptions of hell in the bible are metaphorical. it is hard to discern how someone can pick and choose which parts of the bible are literal and which are metaphorical. it is convenient to do so when your explanations support your understanding. i am not sure how you justify doing this.
 
he states that only one religion can be right or god is schizophrenic. one supposes his assertion is that christianity is the one true religion or god is schizophrenic. this again is a leap of faith. one must also presume that the various religions are not human error in interpreting god's message.

my stand is this, we do not know, and to have faith is great, however by creating a context in which one can have faith by providing erroneous and undeniably false/biased information, a false faith is created. 

faith should be born out of one's desire and belief system. one should not need to discount others because of their faith. to me, doing so indicates weakness in their faith - not strength.

"
1349,"hugh farnham is a blue-collar survivalist who likes to play bridge.  his college-age daughter karen, her friend barbara, his lawyer son duke, his alcoholic wife grace, and house servant joe are playing cards at his house the night the bombs hit.  everyone scrambles to safety inside hugh's modern bomb shelter.

as the bombs fall and his wife is passed out, hugh starts up an affair with his daughter's friend barbara, right in the shelter.  as if hugh's shallowness and arrogance wasn't enough to turn you against the protagonist, this nauseating little scene will.

when the shakes and quakes finally end, the family pours from the shelter to find themselves in an impossible, pristine, clean world.  at first glance, it looks like utopia, but then as they settle into a rustic lifestyle they are suddenly set upon by an advanced race, imprisoned, and brought into a vastly different culture as slaves.  somehow, hugh needs to find a way to break free of the civilization they are trapped in, so that he can be free with barbara.

of all the apocalypse fiction, this book is the worst.  the protagonist is so lowbrow, so arrogant, so unlikable, so self-centered, so shallow, so immoral that he simply cannot capture any interest.  he's not even a ""love to hate"" person.

the dialogue is flatly emotionless and yet irritatingly flippant, and barbara and hugh's constant prattlings of ""darling, dear, and beloved"" do not fit the characters.  neither does hugh's occasional spouting of words like ""shall"" and ""shan't"" along with racial diatribes that include heavy use of the ""n"" word.

there is little emotion from these one-dimensional characters even though they face the death of hugh's daughter and barbara's friend karen, cannibalism, castration (hugh cared more about his ""boys"" than he did his real children), pedophilia, racism, and $exual slavery, they show no more feeling than they would biting into a doughnut.

the entire plot-over-plot had a contrived and vapid feeling to it, as if the author himself didn't quite believe his story.  and if he doesn't believe, how can he expect the reader to?

overall, there is no depth or flavor in this story at all, other than the ugly aftertaste of a musty trailer park visit in the dusty twilight, as old men drink cheap stinking whiskey and the wind blows over the city dump next door.  i recommend avoiding this book.
"
1500,"this is one of the silliest books i have read for a long time. it could be categorised as belonging  to the same genre of ""action fantasy"" as a number of hollywood films.

examples of the rules of reality being abandoned:

the action takes place in the middle of antarctic winter, and the author even notes at one point how it's pitch dark outside, yet there are scenes on the ice that play out as if the characters could see each other.

people spend minutes in freezing water, yet pop out none the worse for the wear.

two close allies of the united states attack a us installation on no better motivation than a claim that a ""spaceship"" has been found there, shouted once through the radio.

a 12-year-old girl goes through hours of commando troops shooting at each other in a closed facility without getting hurt physically, nor, apparently, mentally.

a prototype airplane that has been buried in ice for over ten years, but that works perfectly on the first attempt to fly it.

the stupidity goes on and on, but that's perhaps enough to give a taste. there are perhaps people who do not care about any of this, but i don't enjoy books whose author doesn't have one bit of interest in any sort of realism
"
1904,"when i found out francis collins has written a book about his faith, i ordered it the same day.  after all, we seemed to be following the same path.  i earned a phd in molecular biology in 1981 and had several `firsts' in the area of gene cloning.  then i found christ as a 40-year-old.  my transition was from a semi-serious jew to a materialist to a serious christian.  hearing about dr. collins' spiritual walk had me intrigued.

his book should be entitled ""a politician presents evidence for belief"".  it is a completely uncritical view of the last twenty years of biological research.  the human genome project is elevated to status of ""bridge to a momentous new era"".  hogwash.  hype is the term i would use.  the dept. of energy was duped into footing the bill because the national institutes of health saw it as a waste of resources.  the author couldn't make a better case for the payoff than to show humans have more `junk dna' than previously thought.

dr. collins then explained darwinian gradualism as if it were dogma.  this oversimplification is typical of those who never studied biology except at a medical school.  this is not entirely his fault, however, since many scientific journals will not publish research where evolution isn't perfectly gradual and perfectly random.  their motivation should be perfectly obvious, but it's not even on dr. collins' radar.  he also uses mendel's peas as a pivotal point in our understanding of genetics, assuming the reader would be ignorant that mendel's data was `dry-labbed'.

usually an author who writes on this subject is strong in either biology or theology.  dr. collins relies on two sources for his treatise on theology: st. augustine and  c.s. lewis.  i happen to agree with him that the creation story and the books of job and song of solomon have a ""lyrical and allegorical flavor"".  i would include the book of jonah in that category as well.  however, there is an entire literature on the subject that is completely overlooked.

the only time dr. collins makes a strong case for anything, it is to refute edward o wilson, richard dawkins, and their minions.  even then, he uses a quote from the late stephen jay gould for his most scathing criticism.  francis collins is the consummate politician--he takes a stand without offending anyone.  

dr. collins knows that jesus was not a politician, and he did not worry about offending the intellectual elites of his time. take this quote from mat 23:14 ""woe unto you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.""  dr. collins' book claims to be a middle ground for theists and scientists.  in my opinion it is a  piece of fluff and a narcissistic retelling of the human genome project myth.

120,"i had high expectations for this book, but i was disappointed.  it concentrated too much on digital systems, rather than broadening the definition of noise to cover the natural environment.  i lost interested in the last 1/3 of the book, and couldn't wait to finish
"
442,"i was hoping that miller would turn his talents from the dark side and we would see how well he could reproduce a classical epic.  what we get is a blood splattered ""300 lacedaimons in the hood"".  the spartans are presented to be a buch of homo erotic rastafarians.  the persians rather than the noble middle eastern autocrats presented in their art are drawn by miller to resemble african american gangstas with piercings and skin art everywhere.  i was looking for xerxes to have a grill and whitewalls on his chariot.

if you were into ""sin city"", you will love this mishmashed version of the classical tale of bravery and sacrifice in the face of overwhelming odds

1398,"there is no doubt that antonia fraser's ""the journey"" is written in the author's usual wry, witty and highly engaging style (although i must say that i never before heard of sex described as ""lugubrious."") there is also no doubt that fraser has done a great deal to redeem marie-antoinette's shredded reputation by accurately describing her as being compassionate to the hardships of the french people. the book is full of vivid detail which makes it very readable. however, i was disappointed to see that fraser resorts to many popular misconceptions. for one thing, why does fraser act like marie antoinette was the only princess to be sent away from home as a teenager to seal a dynastic marriage? what about sophie of anhalt-zerbst (catherine the great) who was also a young stranger in a foreign land? this sort of thing happened all the time - it was what being a princess was all about. i was glad that fraser did not fall into the myth of louis xvi's impotence/ phimosis and surgery and all that. she simplistically portrays him as being asexual, which was not true, because he told his aunt after consummating his marriage that he enjoyed ""it."" but never has any other biographer subjected the reader to the spectacle of fersen and the queen fiddling with  primitive prophylactics while consummating their grand passion. i must say, it is a first. fraser insists that marie antoinette slept with fersen for many years and yet gives no solid proof, while at the same time maintaining that she was a woman of high moral character. i usually do not think of a woman who is shared by both a lover and a husband as having a high moral character, but i guess fraser does. oh, well. it is such romantic fantasies that turn this book into more of a soap opera than a serious biography. i found it absurd when fraser insists that the tormented queen of france was ultimately a martyr for the cause of the socialism and democracy which the french people now enjoy. if the queen had had her way, her descendant would be reigning today, and that is just the reality of it. for a better study of marie antoinette's relationship with her husband, i would recommend vincent cronin's ""louis and antoinette."" as for better biographies of the queen, let me join some fellow reviewers in the hope that the works of delorme and bertieres will soon be available in english

1916,"i bought this book after a recent trip with my family to italy.  the food was so wonderful that i wanted to learn more about it.  essentials of classic italian cooking turned out to be exactly what i was looking for.  it explains the basics as well as the regional specialties.  i learned so much!  i highly recommend it

1772,"according to charles kimball, religion is the most powerful and pervasive force on earth.  religion inspires humans to transcend their self-interests, while at the same time, more evil has been committed in the name of religion than any other human institution.  using a comparative religious approach, kimball uncovers five warning signs that increase the likelihood of a religion becoming unhealthy or evil.

kimball argues the word `religion' is amorphous and difficult to define.  as a result, the author believes a comparative religious methodology is necessary, one that sees the similarities and interconnectedness of all religions.  kimball, next, asks if religion is the cause of evil, and he answers both yes and no.  a religion that is arrogant, condescending, and requires adherents to ""disconnect their brain"" is problematic.  on the other hand, religion opens up humanity to a universe of purpose and beauty and teaches how to live meaningful and moral lives as individuals and in community.  kimball seeks to discover the signs that increase the likelihood of religion becoming evil.  

the first warning sign that religion is displaying tendencies towards evil is the belief and adherence to absolute truth claims.  when conceptualizations of god are held with certainty and rigid doctrine, the propensity towards evil increases dramatically.   sacred texts, sources of wisdom and guidance, become abused when selective readings of the text are used to reinforce these absolute truth claims.  christianity and islam have missionary mandates, but these become imperialistic when conversion is forced because of absolute truth claims.  kimball argues for a ""human view of truth"", one that is dynamic and relational, allowing adherents to affirm truth without solidifying truth claims into absolute propositions.

another pivotal point when religion becomes evil is blind obedience: when adherents abdicate personal responsibility to religious authorities.  when a charismatic leader demands total obedience, has unrestricted power, and has total control, religion is unhealthy.  uncritical acceptance of doctrine is also unhealthy, as authentic religion encourages questions and reflection.  strict segregation from the larger society, combined with a leader with unlimited power is dangerous.  kimball asserts that religious inquiry and freedom of thought are necessary for responsible religious adherence.

every religious tradition believes that something is awry on earth, while some believe that an ideal time will arrive in the future.  when adherents believe they can speak for god and wish to usher in this time, the likelihood for disaster increases.  many muslims embrace the hope for an all islamic society, zealous jewish settlers dream of a time when israel will be returned to its divinely promised status, and the christian religious right believe that america should be politically structured with christian principles in mind.  kimball opines those who narrowly define temporal structures of the state and those who believe they are god's agents to usher in a theocracy are dangerous.

religion also becomes a force for evil when the ends justify any means: when one theological component gets elevated, thus becoming an end, and adherents become consumed with achieving or protecting this end.  all religions have notions of sacred space, but an unhealthy religion becomes obsessed with protecting this space.  reinforcing or protecting group identity against an `other', or protecting group identity from within the group, are also potentially dangerous signs.  institutional structures develop in all religious traditions, but corruption occurs when the protection of the institution becomes the end.  kimball asserts that a healthy religion preserves the connection between means and ends.

the last warning sign occurs when religious leaders believe their struggle is a ""holy"" war.  kimball outlines the history of pacifism to the just war theory and crusader ideals within christianity, and he shows how each of these views were represented in the gulf war of 1990-91.  islam is a peaceful religion, which asks adherents to build a just and peaceful social order.  the word jihad means ""struggling in the way of god,"" but in a narrower sense jihad is understood as a struggle in a military sense - with rules similar to the christian just war theory.  because of socio-economic disparities, some muslims openly advocate violent means to achieve revolutionary ends, and some leaders declare this revolution as a holy war in order to legitimize their cause.  kimball believes both that christian and muslim adherents should not speak of war but of peace and that the call for holy war is not holy.

with the knowledge of when religion becomes evil, religions have a clear understanding of healthy praxis.  faith, hope, and love should be the guiding spiritual compass for all religious adherents, so that in times of conflict unhealthy religious mechanisms can be averted.  against secularism, kimball finds validity in religious traditions because of the time-tested wisdom and ethical standards, and he believes that religions should embrace religious diversity.  with religious diversity christians have three options, exclusivism, inclusivism, and pluralism, but kimball believes each position has value if adherents from different faiths work together for the common good of humanity. finally, the middle east represents a microcosm for the world community: if peaceable solutions are not found in the arab-israeli-palestinian conflict, then the future for the world community and world religions are bleak

1182,"this is ann waldron's best mcleod dulaney mystery yet. the characters are so lively and well-drawn they literally walk right off the page (and, in some cases, right into your heart). the setting--the princeton theological seminary--is perfect (a perfect place for a murder, that is), and the plot is downright diabolical. are you in the mood for some humorous, mysterious and sinfully well-written fun? then do yourself a favor and read this delightful book

1707,"i was intrigued by his &quot;the end of history.&quot; i thought his  &quot;trust&quot; was a brilliant book and used it extensively in my  masters thesis and doctoral dissertation. i only hope this latest book is a  disruption in an ongoing chain of good books. in the end, &quot;the great  disruption&quot; is a down right silly book. it has a lot of usefull data  but fukuyama's humanistic ideology clouds it all. all his empirical data  and any real understanding of history undermine his polly-anna conclusion:  that things just have to get better because people are ultimately good.  fukuyama proves that the moral consensus -- the social capital -- of the  earlier era has been wiped away. that crime has sky-rocketed and that the  apparent drops in recent crime rates are only the result of high  incarceration rates and lower percentages of younger men. then he turns  around and wants us to believe that disfunctional behaviour has dropped  because people are naturally gregarious and have a natural inclination to  rebuild social capital. he doesn't bother to deal with societies -- like  ethiopia -- that have never been able to build up enough social capital. he  doesn't really look any further back in history past about 1950. his  generalizations about the 19th century merely show how little he has taken  into account the big picture of history. he thinks (based on his ideology  of human goodness) that things just have to get better. if he had studied  pitirim sorokin for a really big picture of history, he would know better.  people can come to a similar optimistic conclusion as does fukuyama but  they will need to be much better grounded in history if they are going to  make generalizations about long-term historical cycles. for that, i would  recommend robert w. fogel's &quot;the fourth great awakening and the future  of egalitarianism.&quot; fogel, a nobel prize winner, has all the optimism  of fukuyama but with the history to back it up

30,"""the number"" poses an interesting question but provides no helpful answers. a four percent draw on invested assets is as much an old wives' tale as a piece of scientific wisdom, even if it is a number. eisenberg's number is the inverse of that draw down, or twenty-five times.... well, there's the rub, twenty-five times what? income? expenses? income less savings? projected discretionary spending? post-mortgage payoff and college tuition expenses? the proverbial bottom line is clouded by conversations with an eclectic collection of consultants, experts, philosophers, and casual acquaintances. eisenberg, a former esquire editor and short-timer with lands end, ruminates about a simple question: how much money do you need to feel secure? the problem is that security comes in multiple forms: happiness, comfort, excess consumption, ego. and the accuracy and stability of those measures and outcomes is compounded by key assumptions about how long you will live and how healthy those years will be. constructing a one-year budget is hard enough. constructing a thirty-year budget is nearly impossible.

eisenberg doesn't help his case by the offbeat and idiosyncratic examples and profiles he chooses. doctors, divorcees, `downshifters', and very little real data shed little light on the real issues. maybe i knew too much going in. maybe i expected too much from a few positive references from other sources. in the middle i was confused. by the end i was simply disappointed. and i have my own number, and it changes every day
"
1178,"am i the only person that felt this book was twisted, disjointed, and something was just not working?  the beginning was great but the second half left a lot to be desired. this could have been a great story, the author veered off track or something
"
1257,"this book is nothing more than a chaotic brainstorm session with no pertinent information at all. you could save yourself time with a pen and some paper and a group of friends because thats all this author did. book doesnt show you how to start up any of the ideas it just lists them. it also has a plethora of grammatical errors and is almost as if the editor didn't even bother to read it before sending it to the presses. it is a complete waste of time and not worth the ninety cents it costs to buy it used.
"
279,"this book was so simplistic. i was quite disappointed. you get the impression his main goal was simply to reassure people that they are normal after all. a worthy goal, but when discussing something as complex as sexual fantasies i really think one should try to pursue things to their limit. he really held back from delving into any dark territory. his explanations for why someone enjoys certain things left out quite a bit. he always managed to put a happy, positive spin on everything, which is nice, but life isn't that simple
"
689,"definitely not one of his best! slow slow slow...  but at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language, unlike the hero of ""the partner"" who learned a little known spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks
"
1679,"i'm a big nora fan, but i couldn't even finish this one. by the fourth chapter i began to skim. way way way to much detail for me. which made it boring and slow. testing and corrosion, is it fake, is it real ...blah blah blah. enough! i did however enjoy the side story about the brother (i forget his name). but thats it folks. unlike all the other reviewers, i hated it. i say pass on this one. but as you can see, i'm in the minority
"
664,"i haven't done this in awhile, but i don't think i could review this piece any better than the other reviews i've read about it. it's pretty average, however filled with nice bits of knowledge. they didn't seem well-researched in some areas. here are the interesting parts of reviews from the other ""critics"" that i agree with...

1396,"the new age herbalist is a great book. it has a ton of different herbs and tells the uses of each one. they also warm you about anything dangerous  about all of the plants. very useful book perfect for anyone from beginner  to advanced herbalist. i use this book all of the time

1077,"i simply do not see any point in mixing crime fiction with crime and punishment. 

"
1318,"this book does cover alot of information not needed for clep, but it does give you a great guideline on who and what to study for clep and good examples on what questions will look like for the actual clep.  
i wanted to ensure i was prepared for the clep, so i purchased this book and disregarded the other 2 comments.  although, they were right about the obscurity, this book still taught me alot.  
you don't necessarily need it, but if you want to be prepared, this book will not hurt your bank account that much. i also recommend the complete itiots guide to american literature (5 stars, check out the reviews), and the internet.  that is all you need
"
723,"i finished it because a friend recommended it, but had she not, i would have quit after page 20. i wasn't interested in the story or writing. i didn't find the story grotesque; i've read a lot worse dealing with the various topics in this book, but i just didn't find the protagonist very interesting. he went a bit nutty at the end and it is understandable given the situation.  we learn about why he had to stick so tenaciously to his religious beliefs, to redeem himself. his actions didn't seem out of line, either during the war or during the plague, given his dire predicament and previous behaviors and experiences.  i know this is a great example of a book written in second person, and perhaps for that it is worth reading.  i wouldn't pick it up for enjoyment or leisure
"
815,"this is the best book written by stephen king!  i've read it twice and will probably read it about ten more times before i die
