J2wfAQAAIAAJ,Rhetorics of Fantasy,Farah Mendlesohn,"Transcending arguments over the definition of fantasy literature, Rhetorics of Fantasy introduces a provocative new system of classification for the genre. Utilizing nearly two hundred examples of modern fantasy, author Farah Mendlesohn uses this system to explore how fiction writers construct their fantastic worlds. Mendlesohn posits four categories of fantasy—portal-quest, immersive, intrusion, and liminal—that arise out of the relationship of the protagonist to the fantasy world. Using these sets, Mendlesohn argues that the author’s stylistic decisions are then shaped by the inescapably political demands of the category in which they choose to write. Each chapter covers at least twenty books in detail, ranging from nineteenth-century fantasy and horror to extensive coverage of some of the best books in the contemporary field. Offering a wide-ranging discussion and penetrating comparative analysis, Rhetorics of Fantasy will excite fans and provide a wealth of material for scholarly and classroom discussion. Includes discussion of works by over 100 authors, including Lloyd Alexander, Peter Beagle, Marion Zimmer Bradley, John Crowley, Stephen R. Donaldson, Stephen King, C. S. Lewis, Gregory Maguire, Robin McKinley, China Miéville, Suniti Namjoshi, Philip Pullman, J. K. Rowling, Sheri S. Tepper, J. R. R.

IQAvDwAAQBAJ,The Classic Fantasy Collection,"Robert E. Howard, H. P. Lovecraft, G. G. Pendarves, H. G. Wells, William Morris, Lafcadio Hearn, Abraham Merritt, Arthur Machen, Ernest Bramah, Robert W. Chambers, George MacDonald","Epic romances, fearsome dragons and alien worlds lie between the pages of this volume. Containing more than 35 stories from the early masters of fantasy literature, the narratives here transport the reader to alternate worlds where magic abounds, cosmic terrors lie around the corner and intrepid heroes fight for justice. Drawing inspiration from Norse, Japanese and Chinese mythology as well as from traditional fairytales and modern fears, the authors collected here span the breadth of the genre. Including tales from William Morris, H. G. Wells, Robert E. Howard and H. P. Lovecraft amongst others, they demonstrate the plethora of imaginative literature that was written in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many of these tales were foundational works, bringing ideas of the supernatural into the mainstream, and through their efforts creating entirely new genres. Before Tolkien, there were many writers embracing the realm of fantastic fiction. The man responsible for its origin was George MacDonald (1824-1905), a Calvinist minister and Celtic scholar, who wrote the first true fantasy novel. He was followed by a number of imaginative successors at the end of the 19th century, including H. G. Wells, Arthur Machen, and Ernest Bramah. After the end of World War I, the pulp magazines opened up the genre to a new generation of writers - particularly H. P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard - who provided exciting, magical and horrifying tales that fascinated a multitude of readers. By the outbreak of World War II, the outlines of the fantasy genre had been sketched out by these pioneers, and an entirely new type of fiction had been created. This collection includes stories by: Robert E. Howard H. P. Lovecraft G. G. Pendarves H. G. Wells William Morris Lafcadio Hearn Abraham Merritt Arthur Machen Ernest Bramah Robert W.

-QpqVGhf3pMC,Fantasy Freaks and Gaming Geeks,Ethan Gilsdorf,"Fantasy. Science fiction. Role-playing games. People around the globe turn away from the “real” world to inhabit others. Movie fan-freaks design costumes and collect Lord of the Rings action figures. Some attend comic book conventions and Renaissance fairs, others play live-action role-playing games (LARPs). The online game World of Warcraft (WoW) has lured twelve million users worldwide. Even old-school role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) are still wildly popular. What could one man find if he embarked on a journey through fantasy world after fantasy world? In an enthralling blend of travelogue, pop culture analysis, and memoir, forty- year-old former D&D addict Ethan Gilsdorf crisscrosses America, the world, and other worlds—from Boston to New Zealand, and Planet Earth to the realm of Aggramar. On a quest that begins in his own geeky teenage past and ends in our online gaming future, he asks gaming and fantasy geeks how they balance their escapist urges with the kingdom of adulthood. He speaks to grown men who build hobbit holes, and to grown women who play massively multiplayer online games. He seeks out those who dream of elves, long swords, and heroic deeds, and mentally inhabit faraway magical lands. What lures them—old, young, male, female, able-bodied, and disabled—into fantasy worlds, and for what reasons, whether healthy, unhealthy, or in between? Our noble hero battles online goblins, trolls, and sorcerers for weeks on end. He travels to pilgrimage sites: Tolkien’s hometown, movie locations, and castles. He hangs out with Harry Potter tribute bands. He LARPs. He goes to fan conventions and gaming tournaments. He camps with medieval re-enactors—12,000 of them. He becomes Ethor, Ethorian, and Ethor-An3. He sews his own tunic. He even plays D&D. What he discovers is funny, poignant, and enlightening.",Social Science,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=-QpqVGhf3pMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

1_KmBsGozhkC,Fantasy and Your Family,Richard Abanes,"Fantasy and Your Family by bestselling author Richard Abanes presents a much-needed assessment of fantasy - its benefits and its drawbacks. Abanes begins with an in-depth look at folklore, myths, legends, and fairy tales, and their connection to fantasy. Part one also discusses issues involving child development, the affects of literature on children, and how those affects can ultimately change the course of society. Additionally, Abanes examines pop culture, the media, mass marketing, and the commercialization of children's literature by corporations interested primarily in making money. This volume then looks at the life of fantasy writer J.R.R. Tolkien, the popularity of his fantasy works, their content, and what separates them from other fantasy volumes such as Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling and the children's horror books by R.L. Stine. A particularly interesting survey of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings includes a thorough analysis of its storyline, characters, and morality. These are compared side-by-side with Harry Potter. Finally, Abanes gives an overview of our culture's growing obsession with the occult, paganism, and witchcraft. Why is it happening? When did it begin? How is it influencing today's youth? All of these questions are answered through a concise, easy-to-understand writing style. Especially fascinating are the numerous sources of documentations that shows children are indeed being drawn to the occult via Harry Potter. Included are dozens of quotes by Wiccans, neopagans, and occultists that clearly express their belief that Rowling's fantasy will do much to further witchcraft and the occult. - Amazon.",Education,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=1_KmBsGozhkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

22uKzgEACAAJ,Challenging the Fantasy Bond,Robert Firestone,"""Why are many of us compelled to repeat the pain of our past, while avoiding positive experiences that could enrich our lives? In this thought-provoking book, clinical psychologist and theorist Robert Firestone explains how the fantasy bond, an illusion of connection, develops to protect us from negative experiences with parents or caregivers. Later in life, the fantasy bond manifests itself in destructive internal voices and imagined connections to family members, intimate partners, and social groups. Compelling case studies illustrate how these negative voices interfere with true intimacy, and demonstrate how Voice Therapy, a cognitive/affective/behavioral methodology, can be used to counteract destructive internal messages and help individuals embrace the present, instead of living in the past. Challenging our illusions of a merged identity, and moving toward separation and individuation are essential if we are to become fully autonomous human beings. This thorough update of a classic work is particularly timely because it also identifies existential fears that contribute to death anxiety, prejudice, and political divisiveness""--",Defense mechanisms (Psychology),https://books.google.com/books/content?id=22uKzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

This is a story about hope; “Sons of Fantasy” shares the story of M. Alger, a father grieving for the loss of his dear wife, who left him with two beautiful kids. Norris and Socrates were adjusting to life without Mom… But things got more complicated when one of them was paralyzed because of a severe psychological trauma due to an overdose of fantasy... This family has a very interesting neighbor who lives a few feet away. He has a weird little hobby, reading books in the most unlikely places... He for example travelled to Romania and read “Dracula” by Bram Stoker in the Castelul Bran Castle, because it’s said that the main character Dracula lived in it. And then all of a sudden he stopped travelling… He got a month ago a big long hat that belongs to the greatest witch that lived during the middle ages, “Moje Gayla”. In fact, after being burned by the church, one of her relatives kept her belongings inside a wooden box… and in the twentieth century one of her grandchildren donated the box to “The Magic Square Museum” in London.

5zhbMQAACAAJ,Lilith (1895). by George MacDonald,George MacDonald,"Lilith is a fantasy novel written by Scottish writer George MacDonald and first published in 1895. Its importance was recognized in its later revival in paperback by Ballantine Books as the fifth volume of the celebrated Ballantine Adult Fantasy series in September 1969.Lilith is considered among the darkest of MacDonald's works, and among the most profound. It is a story concerning the nature of life, death, and salvation. In the story, MacDonald mentions a cosmic sleep that heals tortured souls, preceding the salvation of all. MacDonald was a Christian universalist, believing that all will eventually be saved. However, in this story, divine punishment is not taken lightly, and salvation is hard-won.Mr. Vane, the protagonist of Lilith, owns a library that seems to be haunted by the former librarian, who looks much like a raven from the brief glimpses he catches of the wraith. After finally encountering the supposed ghost, the mysterious Mr. Raven, Vane learns that Raven had known his father; indeed, Vane's father had visited the strange parallel universe from which Raven comes and goes and now resides therein. Vane follows Raven into the world through a mirror (this symbolistic realm is described as ""the region of the seven dimensions"", a term taken from Jacob Boehme). Inside the world, Vane learns of a house of beds where the dreamers sleep until the end of the world in death: a good death, in which life is found. Vane's grandfather refused to sleep there and is, instead, forced to do battle with skeletons in a haunted wood. After a treacherous journey through a valley (where the moon is the only thing to keep him safe), Mr. Vane meets the Little Ones, children who never grow up, remaining pure children or becoming selfish and getting bigger and dumber, turning into ""bags"" or bad giants. After conversing with Lona, the eldest of the children, Mr. Vane decides to help them, and sets off to gather more information, although the Raven (who is also Adam) has warned Mr. Vane that he needs to sleep along with the dreamers before he can really help them. While on his journey, he meets Lilith, Adam's first wife and the princess of Bulika. Vane, although nearly blinded by Lilith's beauty and charms, eventually leads the Little Ones in a battle against Bulika. Lona, Vane's love, turns out to be Lilith's daughter, and is killed by her own mother. Lilith, however, is captured and brought to Adam and Eve at the house of death, where they struggle to make her open her hand, fused shut, in which she holds the water the Little Ones need to grow. Only when she gives it up can Lilith join the sleepers in blissful dreams, free of sin. After a long struggle, Lilith bids Adam cut her hand from her body; it is done, Lilith sleeps, and Vane is sent to bury the hand; water flows from the hole and washes the land over. Vane is then allowed to join the Little Ones, already asleep, in their dreaming. He takes his bed, next to Lona's, and finds true life in death....",,

SL7yDvso7a0C,Fantasy and Reality in History,Peter Loewenberg,"In Fantasy and Reality in History, Peter Loewenberg brings what the discipline of psychoanalysis has learned about human conduct and the irrational to bear on the analysis and writing of history. The result is a remarkable series of studies on individual and social anxiety, racism and nationalism, and crisis management. First examining early twentieth century Zürich and the first practitioners of psychoanalysis--Freud, C.G. Jung, Karl Abraham, and others--to establish the discipline's understanding of the unconscious and how it functions, Loewenberg then explores the tensions in the lives and politics of modern political leaders. The great British Liberal Prime Minister Walther Rathenau, and the Russian fascist demagogue Vladimir Zhirinovsky are among those studied. In each of these interconnected essays, Fantasy and Reality in History makes readily evident the advantages, and unique insights, that psychoanalytical techniques can provide in the examination of history. Loewenberg's blend of clinical and historico-political methods not only produces new exciting research, but demonstrates how it is done.",History,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=SL7yDvso7a0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

That because he will never die, he must surrender the right to live. For Dr. Russell Pearce, the price is eternal suspicion. He appreciates what synthesizing the elixir vitae from the Immortal’s genetic makeup could mean for humankind. He also fears what will happen should Cartwright’s miraculous blood fall into the wrong hands. For the wealthy and powerful, no price is too great. Immortality is now a fact rather than a dream.

6k4IEAAAQBAJ,The Golden Age of Science Fiction,John Wade,"A detailed look at the British world of science fiction in the 1950s. John Wade grew up in the 1950s, a decade that has since been dubbed the ""golden age of science fiction."" It was a wonderful decade for the genre, but not so great for young fans. With early television broadcasts being advertised for the first time as ""unsuitable for children"" and the inescapable barrier of the ""X"" certificate in the cinema barring anyone under the age of sixteen, the author had only the radio to fall back on—and that turned out to be more fertile for the budding SF fan than might otherwise have been thought. Which is probably why, as he grew older, rediscovering those old TV broadcasts and films that had been out of bounds when he was a kid took on a lure that soon became an obsession. For him, the super-accuracy and amazing technical quality of today's science fiction films pale into insignificance beside the radio, early TV and B-picture films about people who built rockets in their back gardens and flew them to lost planets, or tales of aliens who wanted to take over, if not our entire world, then at least our bodies. This book is a personal account of John Wade's fascination with the genre across all the entertainment media in which it appeared—the sort of stuff he reveled in as a young boy—and still enjoys today.

2O0QDQAAQBAJ,Pseudoscience and Science Fiction,Andrew May,"Aliens, flying saucers, ESP, the Bermuda Triangle, antigravity ... are we talking about science fiction or pseudoscience? Sometimes it is difficult to tell the difference. Both pseudoscience and science fiction (SF) are creative endeavours that have little in common with academic science, beyond the superficial trappings of jargon and subject matter. The most obvious difference between the two is that pseudoscience is presented as fact, not fiction. Yet like SF, and unlike real science, pseudoscience is driven by a desire to please an audience – in this case, people who “want to believe”. This has led to significant cross-fertilization between the two disciplines. SF authors often draw on “real” pseudoscientific theories to add verisimilitude to their stories, while on other occasions pseudoscience takes its cue from SF – the symbiotic relationship between ufology and Hollywood being a prime example of this. This engagingly written, well researched and richly illustrated text explores a wide range of intriguing similarities and differences between pseudoscience and the fictional science found in SF. Andrew May has a degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge University and a PhD in astrophysics from Manchester University. After many years in academia and the private sector, he now works as a freelance writer and scientific consultant. He has written pocket biographies of Newton and Einstein, as well as contributing to a number of popular science books. He has a lifelong interest in science fiction, and has had several articles published in Fortean Times magazine",Science,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=2O0QDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Wells' ""The Greatest Science Fiction Novels & Stories"" is a compelling compilation that showcases the pioneering brilliance of one of the genre's founding figures. The anthology features a selection of his most esteemed works, illustrating Wells' remarkable ability to weave complex narratives that merge scientific innovation with profound social commentary. His distinctive literary style, characterized by accessible prose and vivid imagination, reflects the Victorian era's rampant curiosity about science and its ethical implications, thus capturing the zeitgeist of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Through riveting tales such as ""The War of the Worlds"" and ""The Time Machine,"" Wells not only entertains but invites readers to reflect on themes of progress, dystopia, and the human condition. Wells, often dubbed the 'father of science fiction,' was greatly influenced by his background in science and education, as well as his keen awareness of societal issues stemming from rapid industrialization. His literary journey was marked by an innate desire to provoke thought and debate, which is evident in this anthology. Having witnessed the terrors of war and societal upheaval, he utilized fiction as a vehicle for exploring the potential consequences of humanity's technological advancements, thus imprinting a lasting impact on the genre. This anthology is a must-read for anyone interested in not only the evolution of science fiction but also the relationship between humanity and technology. By diving into Wells' perceptive explorations, contemporary readers can gain invaluable insights into the enduring questions that resonate through the ages.

Cummings' style is starkly evocative, adeptly weaving technical imaginings rooted in the science of his era with the broad, suspenseful strokes of cosmic horror. This carefully crafted narrative not only encapsulates the literary style of pulp science fiction but also serves as a vivid time capsule for the social and scientific anxieties of the early 20th century, offering a glimpse into the contemporary zeitgeist through its allegorical content. DigiCat Publishing's edition ensures this seminal work continues to resonate with the necessary clarity and fidelity to the original text, framing it within the larger oeuvre of world literature. Raymond King Cummings, an American author predominant in the early to mid-20th century, forged a prolific career by tapping the depths of speculative fiction. His writings, deeply influenced by the transformative technological landscapes and innovative possibilities of his era, reflect an imaginative foresight and a speculative zeal. 'The White Invaders' may well have been a confluence of Cummings' fascination with the unknown and his adept skill at extrapolating the future from the science of his days, producing a narrative that's as provocative as it is entertaining. Through Cummings' incisive lens, readers obtain not only a story but also a profound commentary on the expanse of human curiosity and fear. 'The White Invaders' is recommended for enthusiasts of classic science fiction and readers interested in the roots of the genre. Its enduring legacy is cemented by the notable craftsmanship of Cummings, which makes the novel an indispensable conduit into the imaginative potentialities of early speculative literature. As such, this book is an articulate invitation beckoning lovers of literature to engage with the foundational texts that paved the way for contemporary science fiction, through a story whose thematic reverberations are felt even amongst modern narratives.",Fiction,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=zJaCEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

2du2fVYT8ewC,1950s Science Fiction Films and 9/11,Melvin E. Matthews,"1950s Cold War-era monsters meet 21st century terrorists: this exploration of sci-fi movies examines the similarities and differences between the political environment and popular culture of two eras. This examination and appreciation of 1950s science fiction films includes behind-the-scenes tales about their production and many quotes from those who produced and starred in the films. The author draws parallels between the Cold War fears of the 1950s and 60s and the constant ""terrorism alerts"" of the September 11th era, exploring how the politics and the psychological climate of the times influences and is reflected in this vehicle of popular culture. This book is the first of its kind, studying the pop culture genre in the wake of the September 11th tragedy. It shows that, whatever the era and whatever the challenges and crises confronting America, many entertainment themes remain the same, reflecting their respective times and the relevant issues. For instance, Godzilla, the only Fifties-era monster to remain a ""movie star"" beyond that era, could be fashioned to reflect whatever issues dominate the times, be they nuclear war in the Fifties when Godzilla originated to a Seventies Godzilla film about environmental pollution. Conceivably a Godzilla for the age of terrorism is possible. ""Them""! the 1954 atomic mutation classic, is the spiritual ancestor of the 2002 film ""Eight Legged Freaks."" The alien invaders of the Fifties signified a Russian invasion of America, while other films of the genre, such as ""Invaders from Mars,"" depicted aliens utilizing mind control to manipulate humans to commit acts of sabotage, signifying Communist enslavement. If such a film were made now, such invaders could be seen as terrorist masterminds using human slaves to commit terrorist acts. Finally, several Fifties films depicted the end of the world at a time when Americans expected a nuclear war with Russia. The immediate pre-September 11th era witnessed films presenting galactic threats to mankind's existence (""Independence Day,"" ""Deep Impact,"" ""Armageddon""), while the early 2000s witnessed the popularity of the ""Left Behind"" Christian films dramatizing the Tribulation period in the Book of Revelation.",Fiction,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=2du2fVYT8ewC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
_4zcAAAAIAAJ,Terminal Identity,Scott Bukatman,"Scott Bukatman's Terminal Identity--referring to both the site of the termination of the conventional ""subject"" and the birth of a new subjectivity constructed at the computer terminal or television screen--puts to rest any lingering doubts of the significance of science fiction in contemporary cultural studies. Demonstrating a comprehensive knowledge, both of the history of science fiction narrative from its earliest origins, and of cultural theory and philosophy, Bukatman redefines the nature of human identity in the Information Age. Drawing on a wide range of contemporary theories of the postmodern--including Fredric Jameson, Donna Haraway, and Jean Baudrillard--Bukatman begins with the proposition that Western culture is suffering a crisis brought on by advanced electronic technologies. Then in a series of chapters richly supported by analyses of literary texts, visual arts, film, video, television, comics, computer games, and graphics, Bukatman takes the reader on an odyssey that traces the postmodern subject from its current crisis, through its close encounters with technology, and finally to new self-recognition. This new ""virtual subject,"" as Bukatman defines it, situates the human and the technological as coexistent, codependent, and mutally defining. Synthesizing the most provocative theories of postmodern culture with a truly encyclopedic treatment of the relevant media, this volume sets a new standard in the study of science fiction--a category that itself may be redefined in light of this work. Bukatman not only offers the most detailed map to date of the intellectual terrain of postmodern technology studies--he arrives at new frontiers, providing a propitious launching point for further inquiries into the relationship of electronic technology and culture.",Computers,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=_4zcAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

OaywBgAAQBAJ,Suicide and Contemporary Science Fiction,Carl Gutiérrez-Jones,"Suicide and Contemporary Science Fiction examines the fascination with suicidal crises evident in a range of science fiction. Specifically, this study explores a seemingly counterintuitive proposition: in moments of dramatic scientific and technological change, the authors of these works frequently cast self-destructive episodes as catalysts for beneficial change. Carlos Gutierrez-Jones argues that this creative self-destruction mechanism is invoked by H. G. Wells as a means of negotiating Victorian anxieties regarding evolutionary theory, by Stanislaw Lem as he wrestles with the prospect of nuclear self-destruction at the dawn of the space age, by William Gibson as he considers the development of artificial intelligence, by Christopher Nolan as he explores the cybernetic colonization of the unconscious, by Rian Johnson as he links aspects of video gaming to the neoliberal militarization of institutions, and by Margaret Atwood as she considers impending ecological disaster and the rise of bioterrorism.

It offers a new conceptualisation of the field today, marking the significant changes that have taken place in sf studies over the past 15 years. Building on the pioneering research in the first edition, the collection reorganises historical coverage of the genre to emphasise new geographical areas of cultural production and the growing importance of media beyond print. It also updates and expands the range of frameworks that are relevant to the study of science fiction. The periodisation has been reframed to include new chapters focusing on science fiction produced outside the Anglophone context, including South Asian, Latin American, Chinese and African diasporic science fiction. The contributors use both well- established critical and theoretical approaches and embrace a range of new ones, including biopolitics, climate crisis, critical ethnic studies, disability studies, energy humanities, game studies, medical humanities, new materialisms and sonic studies. This book is an invaluable resource for students and established scholars seeking to understand the vast range of engagements with science fiction in scholarship today.

The combination of the existential nature of this current trend in science fiction with the genre’s ability to manifest these abstract concepts in a generic environment that is historically focused on new frontiers and ideas creates a powerful set of media texts that ask audiences to contemplate what it means to exist, think, and connect as human beings.

By surveying these haunting traces of another medium in early science fiction discourse, we can begin to see the key role that a cinematic mindedness played in this formative era and to expand the early history of science fiction as a cultural idea beyond the usual boundaries that have been staked out by its literary manifestations and the genre's historians.",Literary Criticism,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=ajmdDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

And have such vitality that, even though you're perfectly proud of the age you are, people routinely think you're several years younger? This happy state is the promise of Younger by the Day, a one - year program for aging in reverse with results that start as soon as you do -- and you can start any day of the year. Victoria Moran was baffled when midlife seemed to change everything, from the shape of her body to her visibility in society. She began a four - year journey, asking these questions: Why do some women blossom with age while others wither? How can you accept yourself as you are and still nurture yourself into becoming the best you can be? How can you draw from your inner wisdom everything you need to deal with the un-certainties of life as well the certainty of growing older?

d_9ZAAAAMAAJ,Friendship and Love in the Middle English Metrical Romances,Anna Hubertine Reuters,"«Friendship and Love in the Middle English Metrical Romances» groups together a representative cross-section of the genre, according to variants of love relationships, and to ideas of friendship. The horizontal and the vertical structure of the relatonship are tripartite. The horizontal stages are attraction, separation-testing-trial, and reunion, the vertical spheres are the personal, social/political, and religious. All relationships fail into two types, the restorative-concordant and the innovative-discordant. These are defined by the relative position of the partners in the social-political sphere of their relationship. The groups of relationship are defined by the initially more active partner: forward heroine, fairy mistress, forward hero, mutual love, married love; friendship, lords and retainers. Surveys of the Insular understanding of courtly love, and of Caxton's prose romances, complement the findings.",Foreign Language Study,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=d_9ZAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

ysq8EAAAQBAJ,"The ""Mystery of History"", its Functionalisation and Disintegration in Graham Swift’s ""Waterland""",Thorben Höppner,"Seminar paper from the year 2021 in the subject English Language and Literature Studies - Literature, grade: 1,0, , language: English, abstract: This paper investigates how the ambivalent, perhaps even ambiguous definition of ‘historia’ relates to the representation of history in the novel and how this representation again relates to its functionalisation by Tom Crick. To answer this question, this paper will primarily work with Linda Hutcheon’s notion of ‘historiographic metafiction’ while also pointing out similarities to the reading of Waterland as a trauma narrative. In taking a closer look at the protagonist-narrator himself, this paper argues that the protection “from chaos and disorder”, which Landow addresses, is only achieved through a form of historical escapism. Superficially speaking, Graham Swift’s Waterland is a novel about a history teacher who, having lost his job, forsakes the formal teaching of history, and embarks on an extracurricular journey into his own past. However, upon closer examination, Waterland is more than that, a novel about history itself. It explores “the whole mystery of ‘history’”, as Swift himself puts it in the introduction to the novel (Waterland, xv). Thus, it is only logical that the novel prefaces its narrative with an insightful epigraph: a dictionary definition of the Latin word ‘historia’, from which the English word ‘history’ originates. As can be seen above, however, said definition is ambivalent- it is “inherently polysemantic” as Judith Ryan notes. James Acheson has likewise pointed out that the fact that “historia can mean either history or fiction is significant, for the historian and the writer of fiction must deal with similar problems in writing about the past”. The natural tendency of language towards proliferation of its meaning aside, the epigraph leaves us with a very ambivalent concept of history, which the narrative of Waterland, in its dealing with history, then builds on. Since such a prominent theme in Waterland, the novel’s representation of history has been thoroughly examined in secondary literature; particularly against the theoretical background of what Linda Hutcheon has identified as ‘historiographic metafiction’.",Literary Criticism,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=ysq8EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

U0AiOyzUUusC,Murder at the Academy Awards (R),"Joan Rivers, Jerrilyn Farmer","As the Queen of the Red Carpet, Joan Rivers has been eyewitness to Hollywood's most heinous crimes (okay, so they're fashion-related). And in this über-stylish mystery, she enlists her no-holds-barred, slightly blonder literary counterpart, Maxine Taylor, to solve a crime of a different sort. When a gorgeous young actress dies on the Red Carpet, some in Tinseltown call it bad publicity. Max calls it murder. The Academy Awards®. It's Hollywood's biggest night, and there's no star better equipped than the tart-tongued Max Taylor to hold court on the glamorous Red Carpet. Sharing the dish with her daughter, Drew, the calls-it-as-she-sees-it entertainer has parlayed this star-studded annual gig into television's most-watched pre-show event. And tonight, Max has landed a real coup—an exclusive interview with Halsey Hamilton, a fabulous, young, paparazzi-trailed Oscar nominee. But not even Max, who's seen her share of celebrity train wrecks, is prepared for an incoherent Halsey, straight out of rehab, to stumble up to the mic, slur a few cryptic words, and drop dead at the hem of Max's stunning Michael Kors gown. To Hollywood, the starlet's demise was tragic but inevitable. To Max, it looks more like a perfectly calculated crime. After all, she alone heard Halsey's final whisper—a clue that leads Max to the pricey rehab clinic Wonders. With a weakness for nothing more disturbing than artificial sweeteners, Max nonetheless goes undercover and embarks on a twelve-step investigation into murder. Once inside the luxury clinic, Max's list of suspicious players expands faster than the Jolie-Pitt family: Burke Norris, a professional cad and Drew's ex-fiancé; Halsey's father, who is still making money off his dead daughter's fame; Halsey's jealous younger sister; and Rojo Bernstein, a tattooed karate hipster who knew the troubled fallen star much better than anyone suspected. Now it's left to Max to unravel the sordid motives and find Halsey's killer while upstaging an over-the-top Hollywood memorial service and funeral where the ill-fated actress was buried in, of all things, a tacky designer knockoff!

6YQ7s4N3A00C,The Mystery of Edwin Drood,Charles Dickens,"'Where is my nephew?, asked Mr Jasper, wildly. 'Where is your nephew?' repeated Neveille. 'Why do you ask me?' 'I ask you,' retorted Jasper, 'because you were the last person in his company, and he is not to be found.' The Mystery of Edwin Drood, Dickens's last novel, lay unfinished at his death. Speculation remains rife as to its probably conclusion; evidence suggests that, fascinated as Dickens was by details of the plotting, his basic concern was for character and appropriate setting, in particular the character of the hero-villain, Jasper. The ancient city of Cloisterham, its cathedral a reminder of mortality, human frailty, and the lawful life, is an effective background for what Dickens daughter called a tale of 'the tragic secrets of the human heart'. Humour is provided by a host of characters ranging fro Mr Grewgious, the admirable though eccentric lawyer, and Miss Twinkleton, guardian of the Young Ladies' Seminary, to Durdles, the hard-drinking stonemason, and Deputy, the irreverent lodging-house boy. This edition contains Dickens's working plans for the novel, and the text is that of the authoritative Clarendon edition. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe.

_zWFBAAAQBAJ,Theory of Social Constructivism. The United Nations Security Council in Libya,Christian Graf,"Seminar paper from the year 2014 in the subject Politics - Topic: Peace and Conflict, Security, grade: 1,3, University of Bamberg, language: English, abstract: The United Nations (UN) in international relations is considered to be a supranational organization. Currently the UN consist of 193 Member States and it stresses out four main purposes, which are maintaining peace and security, developing friendly relations amongst states, helping states to work together and being a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations (cf. www.un.org/en/aboutun). Additionally the UN is seen as a collective security system, which offers states to settle down any disputes and for solving social, economic, humanitarian and ecological problems on international level (cf. Gareis/Varwick 2006: 85). According to this purposes, the UN has acted and authorized multilateral interventions in many states, which were affected by conflicts. The Libyan conflict in 2011, as an example, was one of the cases where the UN has responded to. The actions and the multilateral intervention in Libya leaves questions. How does the UN shape the behavior of its Member States and why does the UN act in general? The theory of social constructivism by Alexander Wendt, can provide an explanation to these questions. The theory defines balances of power between states and explains the behavior of states. Furthermore it claims that international relations are social and the international system is constituted by ideas (cf. Jackson/Sorensen 2006: 162). But the main question which shall be discussed in this term paper is therefore: „How can the theory of social constructivism explain the actions by the United Nations Security Council in Libya?“ First of all core assumptions of social constructivism has to be discussed in order to explain further analysis of this term paper. After the illustration of the core assumptions of social constructivism, the powers and functions of the UN Security Council shall be described, because the Security Council, as one of the most important main body of the UN, is the only executive body that act regarding any threat of peace and security. Thereafter the situation in Libya, as the empirical example have to be mentioned. What exactly happened in Libya and what did the UN especially the Security Council do? Altogether with the core assumptions of social constructivism, the theoretical knowledge of the Security Council and the information of the Libyan conflict, the main question shall be answered. At the end the conclusion shall summarize the term paper ́s outcome of the analysis.",Political Science,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=_zWFBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

War is a paradox—horrifying and compelling, galvanizing and devastating, a phenomenon that separates and decimates while at the same time creating and strengthening national identity and community bonds. War is the stuff of great drama. War and theatre is a subject of increasing popularity among scholars of theatre. The essays in this special edition of Theatre History Studies brings together a unique collection of work by thirteen innovative scholars whose work explores such topics as theatre performances during war times, theatre written and performed to resist war, and theatre that fosters and promotes war. The contributors to this volume write poignantly about nationhood and about how war—through both propaganda and protest—defines a people. The contributors also delve into numerous fascinating themes that transcend time, peoples, nations, and particular conflicts: the foundations of nationalism and the concepts of occupied and occupier, nostalgia and utopia, and patriotism and revolution. These essays survey a march of civil and international wars spanning three centuries. Arranged chronologically, they invite comparisons between themes and trace the development of the major themes of war.

uPzKswEACAAJ,The New History,Alun Munslow,"The notion of 'history' has always been one strenuously debated by both academics and the wider population. This deeply provocative re-thinking of our engagement with the past by one of the world's leading post-modern historians takes that debate one step further. Alun Munslow re-assesses history in the light of post-modernism and other intellectual challenges which have questioned the primacy of the modernist epistemology of empiricism. In an original and stimulating vision of history that will intrigue all those seriously interested in the subject, Munslow argues that history is not only about the sources, but a literary construction. Munslow concludes that history, as a cultural narrative about the past can never tell us what the past really means. This far reaching conclusion is based on the radical idea that the content of history is defined as much by the nature of the language used to represent and interpret that content as it is by research into the sources. This suggests that history does not produce the most likely meaning of the past but rather can only generate alternative meanings. The lead volume in a major new series on historical thinking and practice, this is an accessible yet absorbing study that breaks new ground in discussing the stage history is at now, and perhaps most engagingly, the direction it will take in the future.",,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=uPzKswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

He has from time to time brought his skills to bear upon historical scholarship, most notably perhaps in his book Between Past and Present (1958, 2nd edition, 1973), his interpretive essays in the philosophy of history Philosophy, History and Politics (1976) and his scholarly work concerned with the influence of historical development upon modern Jewish thought, Tradition and Reality (1972). Related to these, and equally works of that philosophical humanity which Professor Rotenstreich embodies, are his Humanism in the Contemporary Era (1963), Spirit and Man: An Essay on Being and Value (1963) and Reflection and Action (1983). Rotenstreich combines both the naturalistic and the phenomenological attitudes in an interesting and illuminating way through the full spectrum of issues in the philosophy of history in this century. Surely he sets boundaries to any doubtful extrapolation. Not only would he bring the understanding of history back from those who claim it as only a positive science but equally would he prevent the transformation of that understanding into merely speculative inquiry.",Philosophy,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=P8sLAqUAek4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

From bloody skirmishes with Indians on the early frontier to the Logan County mine war, the story of West Virginia is punctuated with episodes as colorful and rugged as the mountains that dominate its landscape. In this first modern comprehensive history, Otis Rice and Stephen Brown balance these episodes of mountaineer individualism against the complexities of industrial development and the growth of social institutions, analyzing the events and personalities that have shaped the state. To create this history, the authors weave together many strands from the past and present. Included among these are geological and geographical features; the prehistoric inhabitants; exploration and settlement; relations with the Indians; the land systems and patterns of ownership; the Civil War and the formation of the state from the western counties of Virginia; the legacy of Reconstruction; politics and government; industrial development; labor problems and advances; and cultural aspects such as folkways, education, religion, and national and ethnic influences. For this second edition, the authors have added a new chapter, bringing the original material up to date and carrying the West Virginia story through the presidential election of 1992. Otis K. Rice is professor emeritus of history and Stephen W.

Nielsen begins by outlining Herodotus's Greek context with its roots in Ionic natural philosophy, the epic tradition and Attic tragedy, and goes on to analyse in some detail the outworking of the Herodotean tragedy. Against that background, the Deuteronomistic History is to be viewed as an ancient Near Eastern historiographic text in the tragic tradition.",Religion,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=AJWizgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

He isolates certain persistent ideas about poetry's situation relative to life and focuses on the conflict the poet faces between the nature of words and poetic forms on one side, and the nature of experience on the other. The author ranges for his often surprising examples from Keats to the great modernists such as Stevens and Williams, to the contents of recent magazines. He considers work by Ammons, Ashbery, Bogan, Ginsberg, Lowell, Merwin, O'Hara, and younger writers, offering judgments and enthusiasms from a viewpoint that is consistent but unstereotyped. Like his poetry, Robert Pinsky's criticism joins the traditional and the innovative in ways that are thoughtful and unmistakably his own. His book is a bold essay on the contemporary situation in poetry, on the dazzling achievements of modernism, and on the nature or ""situation"" of poetry itself.",Literary Criticism,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=v-A9DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

CiGTJBTFbkgC,Close Listening,Charles Bernstein,"Close Listening brings together seventeen strikingly original essays, especially written for this volume, on the poetry reading, the sound of poetry, and the visual performance of poetry. While the performance of poetry is as old as poetry itself, critical attention to modern and postmodern poetry performance has been surprisingly slight. This volume, featuring work by critics and poets such as Marjorie Perloff, Susan Stewart, Johanna Drucker, Dennis Tedlock, and Susan Howe, is the first comprehensive introduction to the ways in which twentieth-century poetry has been practiced as a performance art. From the performance styles of individual poets and types of poetry to the relation of sound to meaning, from historical and social approaches to poetry readings to new imaginations of prosody, the entries gathered here investigate a compelling range of topics for anyone interested in poetry. Taken together, these essays encourage new forms of ""close listenings""--not only to the printed text of poems but also to tapes, performances, and other expressions of the sounded and visualized word. The time is right for such a volume: with readings, spoken word events, and the Web gaining an increasing audience for poetry, Close Listening opens a number of new avenues for the critical discussion of the sound and performance of poetry.",Literary Criticism,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=CiGTJBTFbkgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Paul Kane argues that the absence of Romanticism functions as a crucial presence in the poetry of all the major Australian poets. This absence or negativity is both thematic and structural, and Kane's scrupulous analyses uncover important relations between Romanticism and negativity. Chapters on nine individual poets explore and substantiate the theoretical claims informed by the work of contemporary critics of Romanticism and by various philosophers of negativity. These chapters can serve as a series of self-contained readings of Australian poets for the use of students, scholars, and informed general readers.

b_yqDwAAQBAJ,Radical as Reality,Peter Campion,"What do American poets mean when they talk about freedom? How can form help us understand questions about what shapes we want to give our poetic lives, and how much power we have to choose those shapes? For that matter, what do we even mean by we? In this collection of essays, Peter Campion gathers his thoughts on these questions and more to form an evolutionary history of the past century of American poetry. Through close readings of the great modernists, midcentury objectivists, late twentieth-century poets, his contemporaries, and more, Campion unearths an American poetic landscape that is subtler and more varied than most critics have allowed. He discovers commonalities among poets considered opposites, dramatizes how form and history are mutually entailing, and explores how the conventions of poetry, its inheritance, and its inventions sprang from the tensions of ordinary life. At its core, this is a book about poetic making, one that reveals how the best poets not only receive but understand and adapt what comes before them, reinterpreting the history of their art to create work that is, indeed, radical as reality.",Literary Criticism,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=b_yqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

ysUItQEACAAJ,Understanding Poetry,Helen Doss,"Understanding Poetry: An Introduction provides students with strategies for reading, analyzing, and writing about poetry in ways that reveal the nature, purpose, and process of poetry. The book encourages students to search for meanings with poems across multiple traditions, from the 12th to the 21st centuries. The text begins with a chapter that examines the process and purpose of literary analysis. Later chapters explore explicit and implicit meaning, the construction of rhyme, word order, and syntax, and the use of repetition, contradiction, paradox, and juxtaposition within poetry. Students learn the ways in which context, significance, and genre factor into the understanding and enjoyment of the art form. They consider form, meter, and meaning, and learn the ways critical perspectives can contribute to interpretation and analysis of a variety of poems. Closing chapters serve as casebooks, which provide robust coverage of haiku, sonnets, and epic poetry. Throughout, students read historical and contemporary works by leading poets and take part in assignments that sharpen their critical and creative skills. A comprehensive exploration of the form, Understanding Poetry is an ideal resource for courses in English literature and literary analysis. Helen Doss, Ph.D. is a professor of English and Literature as well as the coordinator of first-year composition within the Department of English, Literature and Reading at Wilbur Wright College, one of the City Colleges of Chicago. She holds a Ph.D. from the University of California, Santa Cruz in literature with specialization in the history of science and pre- and early modern literature.

The News from Poems brings together newly commissioned essays by eminent poets and scholars of poetry and serves as a companion volume to an earlier anthology of engaged poetry compiled by the editors. Essays by Bob Perelman, Steven Gould Axelrod, Tony Hoagland, Eleanor Wilner, and others reveal how recent poetry has redefined our ideas of politics, authorship, identity, and poetics. The volume showcases the diversity of contemporary American poetry, discussing mainstream and experimental poets, including some whose work has sparked significant controversy.

Twenty-two chapters deal with subjects like 'The Constituencies for Art', 'What Meaning Means', 'Acceptable and Unacceptable Propositions', 'The Right Word in the Right Place', 'The Sounds that Matter in Poetry', 'Energetic Metaphor: the Major Figure' and so on, including an eloquent epilogue 'Touching Genius'.

BDyI0QEACAAJ,The Marginalization of Poetry,Bob Perelman,"Language writing, the most controversial avant-garde movement in contemporary American poetry, appeals strongly to writers and readers interested in the politics of postmodernism and in iconoclastic poetic form. Drawing on materials from popular culture, avoiding the standard stylistic indications of poetic lyricism, and using nonsequential sentences are some of the ways in which language writers make poetry a more open and participatory process for the readers. Reading this kind of writing, however, may not come easily in a culture where poetry is treated as property of a special class. It is this barrier that Bob Perelman seeks to break down in this fascinating and comprehensive account of the language writing movement. A leading language writer himself, Perelman offers insights into the history of the movement and discusses the political and theoretical implications of the writing. He provides detailed readings of work by Lyn Hejinian, Ron Silliman, and Charles Bernstein, among many others, and compares it to a wide range of other contemporary and modern American poetry. A variety of issues are addressed in the following chapters: ""The Marginalization of Poetry,"" ""Language Writing and Literary History,"" ""Here and Now on Paper,"" ""Parataxis and Narrative: The New Sentence in Theory and Practice,"" ""Write the Power,"" ""Building a More Powerful Vocabulary: Bruce Andrews and the World (Trade Center),"" ""This Page Is My Page, This Page Is Your Page: Gender and Mapping,"" ""An Alphabet of Literary Criticism,"" and ""A False Account of Talking with Frank O'Hara and Roland Barthes in Philadelphia.""",Language Arts & Disciplines,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=BDyI0QEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

When a 'great poet' sets himself the task of some 'big theme' he needs only to hold, as it were, a magnifying glass to the earth. We, who are born and live here, like very much to imagine other worlds, and we have even mentally constructed such another in which to exist after dying on this one; but we were careful to make it a glorified version of our own earth with everything we most love here intensified and improved to the utmost stretch of human imagination.

Informed by a consideration to the psychology of invention, Michelle Bonczek Evory¿s writing philosophy emphasizes both spontaneity and discipline, teaching students how to capture the chaos in our memories, imagination, and bodies with language, and discovering ways to mold them into their own cosmos, sculpt them like clay on a page. Exercises aim to make writing a form of play in its early stages that gives way to more enriching insights through revision, embracing the writing of poetry as both a love of language and a tool that enables us to explore ourselves and understand the world. Naming the Unnameable promotes an understanding of poetry as a living art and provides ways for students to involve themselves in the growing contemporary poetry community that thrives in America today.",,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=IjpStAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Over the years, Mr. McCarthy had a predilection towards writing occasional poetry and limericks but was not motivated to write poems of any consequence until he met his wife (Teresa) in the 1980s. As their relationship grew, Mr. McCarthy took to writing poetry to Teresa in an attempt to capture the moment of this new and powerful force in their lives. This resulted in a collection of poems that was published as Mr. McCarthyas first book of poetry in 1988. Subsequently, Mr. McCarthy wrote poetry with a number of different themes.

OkHCDwAAQBAJ,Silence and Articulacy in the Poetry of Medbh McGuckian,Maureen E. Ruprecht Fadem,"Silence and Articulacy in the Poetry of Medbh McGuckian is an innovative contribution to the scholarship on Belfast poet, Medbh McGuckian. This book considers the entire oeuvre of this globally respected Irish woman writer, a member of the contemporary avant-garde with now fifteen (U.S. published) volumes and numerous individual publications. The author positions McGuckian’s oeuvre as political and historical poetry and offers a provocative new assessment of its crafted silences. This work argues that it is the muted character of McGuckian’s poems—a consequence of a defamiliarized language, the overwhelming sway of the image, and a profusion of intertextual quoting—that constitutes their agency and force. The silences are read as a response to the precarious positionality of poet and speaker at the site of “disaster” and the limits of articulacy. In line with Rukeyser’s notion of the life of poetry, the life of McGuckian's silences is located, Fadem argues, in the poems’ production, as revealed self-reflexively, and in their prolonged consumption. This oeuvre operates as a formidable counter-discourse by converting poetry's reception into a much protracted task that redistributes the temporal economy of poem and reader and disrupts the given structures of time, place, and the order of things.",Literary Criticism,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=OkHCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
fPxZAAAAMAAJ,English Poetry and the English Language,Frederick Wilse Bateson,The thesis advanced in this short book is that a proper understanding and appreciation of poetry is not obtained by investigating the particular poet's career or the nature of the society in which he has grown up. These are at best secondary considerations. It is the special uses to which he puts his society and personality in the language of his time that are ultimately decisive. The thesis is illustrated in a survey of English poetry from the Renaissance to the present day. In this third edition the opportunity has been taken to expand the arguemnt and bring some of its details up to date. -- Book Jacket.,Language Arts & Disciplines,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=fPxZAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

3lNhAAAAMAAJ,The Rhetoric of Renaissance Poetry,"Thomas O. Sloane, Raymond B. Waddington","""The Rhetoric of Renaissance Poetry is meant to demonstrate to the modern student the general importance of rhetoric in the study of English Poetry in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. By argument and by example the ten essays serve to define the present state of rhetorical criticism as it is practiced by younger generation of scholar-critics, trained upon those monumental studies by Tuve, Howell, and Ong which spurred the revival of rhetoric in literary study. The present essays are characterized by their common effort to implement the rhetorical approach as a more flexible, subtler, and wider -ranging critical methodology than that employed by critics before the revival. Accordingly, there are efforts to discriminate more precisely the nature and evolution of Renaissance rhetoric; to respect the differences between rhetorical theory and poetic practice; to subject to scrutiny kinds of poetry not usually associated with rhetorical structures, figures , and techniques, there emerges as well a significant concern with the broader rhetorical situation, such as the projected speaker-audience relationship, the definition of audience and of speaker's voice, and the ways in which the rhetoric of a poem involves the reader directly in the formulation of its meaning. Rhetorical criticism is the subject of the volume, but it is a kind which has been absorbed increasingly into the mainstream of critical methodology, distinguished itself by a dominant attitude or point of view rather than by a single-minded application of the rules and definition from rhetoric handbooks. Through this syncretic flexibility the volume best reveals the richly heuristic qualities of the rhetorical approach to poetry. Because the collection includes a number of essays which are important, and even provocative, in their implications, it will be of interest to specialist and students of this period generally as well as to those more particularly concerned with rhetoric.""-Publisher",Language Arts & Disciplines,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=3lNhAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Cc4uzAEACAAJ,The Motive for Metaphor,Henry M. Seiden,"This book is a small anthology: each chapter a kind of meditation-on poetry and psychoanalysis; on a poem, sometimes two; on poetry in general; on thought itself. The poems are beautiful, some are contemporary, some are classical and well worth a reader's attention. ""The motive for metaphor"" is the title of a short poem of Wallace Stevens in which he says he is ""happy"" with the subtleties of experience. He likes what he calls the ""half colours of quarter things,"" as opposed to the certainties, the hard primary ""reds"" and ""blues."" To grasp and make sense of what is elusive (and beautiful), that is, for the essential and puzzling condition of poetry, we are obliged to make metaphors. The same is perhaps true of psychoanalysis-this is the essential argument of the book.The chapters were originally poetry columns that the author wrote for Psychologist-Psychoanalyst and Division/Review (both journals of the Division of Psychoanalysis of the American Psychological Association). The chapters are arranged alphabetically by poet but otherwise follow no conceptual order. The author hopes that they might be read that way too-the book to be picked up, a few chapters read and thought about, and then put aside for reading more at another time.With a Foreword by Nancy McWilliams, PhD.",Poetry,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=Cc4uzAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

1arGI9NZcAkC,An Introductory Philosophy of Medicine,James A. Marcum,"In this book the author explores the shifting philosophical boundaries of modern medical knowledge and practice occasioned by the crisis of quality-of-care, especially in terms of the various humanistic adjustments to the biomedical model. To that end he examines the metaphysical, epistemological, and ethical boundaries of these medical models. He begins with their metaphysics, analyzing the metaphysical positions and presuppositions and ontological commitments upon which medical knowledge and practice is founded. Next, he considers the epistemological issues that face these medical models, particularly those driven by methodological procedures undertaken by epistemic agents to constitute medical knowledge and practice. Finally, he examines the axiological boundaries and the ethical implications of each model, especially in terms of the physician-patient relationship. In a concluding Epilogue, he discusses how the philosophical analysis of the humanization of modern medicine helps to address the crisis-of-care, as well as the question of “What is medicine?” The book’s unique features include a comprehensive coverage of the various topics in the philosophy of medicine that have emerged over the past several decades and a philosophical context for embedding bioethical discussions. The book’s target audiences include both undergraduate and graduate students, as well as healthcare professionals and professional philosophers. “This book is the 99th issue of the Series Philosophy and Medicine...and it can be considered a crown of thirty years of intensive and dynamic discussion in the field. We are completely convinced that after its publication, it can be finally said that undoubtedly the philosophy of medicine exists as a special field of inquiry.”",Medical,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=1arGI9NZcAkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Along the way, central topics in philosophy of science, such as the demarcation of science from non-science, induction, confirmation and falsification, the relationship between theory and observation and relativism are all addressed.

Are the writings that have come down to us over the centuries from philosophers of genius mere souvenirs from a bygone era? Or are their thoughts still eminently worth examining with care? Modern Challenges to Past Philosophy argues pondering past philosophy with modern problems in mind is worth the effort, even though earlier works are uninformed by modern science and lack some of tools of modern analysis. The great texts defamiliarize our world and offer solutions to crucial questions often forgotten as we fixate on current philosophical trends. Modern Challenges is no appeal to a return to a golden past but a study designed to show how and why understanding earlier works of some of the most penetrating minds ever to ponder eternally valid questions can contribute to a renewal of our own culture.",Philosophy,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=EPklmwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The history of western philosophy provides the framework for broaching critical questions pertinent to these three topics. The book explores philosophical anthropology on its most foundational level, with a focus on the basic constituents of the unified self. The coverage of the work is broad in scope, moving from the Pre-Socratics to Postmodernism, critically assessing what transpired during the intervening 2500 year period, but with special attentiveness to the contributions of the Aristotelian/Thomistic tradition of inquiry. While each chapter can stand on its own, they collectively reveal a developing story that finds expression in diverse attempts to come to terms with what it means to be human, and how we understand ourselves as persons.

It is in Greek that the questions which shaped the destiny of Western culture were asked, and so were the first attempts at an answer, and the search for a method of investigation. This book tries to rediscover the propulsive force that for over two millennia spread, and still lives in our system of thought. By systematically quoting the very words of the leading actors and by tracing their sources, it leads the reader along a path where they will be able to observe the establishment of philosophical ideas and language, in an updated and balanced picture of archaic lore, of the thought of the classical and hellenistic ages, and of the philosophy of late antiquity.

GpVqDwAAQBAJ,Herder's Philosophy,Michael N. Forster,"Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803) is a towering figure in modern thought, but one who has hitherto been severely underappreciated. Michael Forster seeks to rectify that situation He considers Herder's philosophy in the round and argues that it is both far more impressive in quality and far more influential in modern thought than has previously been realized. After an introduction on Herder's intellectual biography, philosophical style, and general program in philosophy, there are chapters on his philosophy of language, his hermeneutics, his theory of translation, his contribution of the philosophical foundations for both linguistics and cultural anthropology, his philosophy of mind, his aesthetics, his moral philosophy, his philosophy of history, his political philosophy, his philosophy of religion, and his intellectual influence. Forster argues that Herder contributed vitally important ideas in all of these areas; that in many of them his ideas were seminal for major subsequent philosophers, including Friedrich Schlegel, Schleiermacher, Wilhelm von Humboldt, Hegel, and Nietzsche; that they indeed founded whole new disciplines, such as linguistics, anthropology, and comparative literature; and that moreover they were in many cases even better than what these subsequent thinkers and disciplines went on to make of them.",Philosophy,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=GpVqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
dwdREAAAQBAJ,Passion and Action,Susan James,"Passion and Action explores the place of the emotions in seventeenth-century understandings of the body and mind, and the role they were held to play in reasoning and action. Interest in the passions pervaded all areas of philosophical enquiry, and was central to the theories of many major figures, including Hobbes, Descartes, Malebranche, Spinoza, Pascal, and Locke. Yet little attention has been paid to this topic in studies of early modern thought. Susan James surveys the inheritance of ancient and medieval doctrines about the passions, then shows how these were incorporated into new philosophical theories in the course of the seventeenth century. She examines the relation of the emotions to will, knowledge, understanding, desire, and power, offering fresh analyses and interpretations of a broad range of texts by little-known writers as well as canonical figures, and establishing that a full understanding of these authors must take account of their discussions of our affective life. Passion and Action also addresses current debates, particularly those within feminist philosophy, about the embodied character of thinking and the relation between emotion and knowledge. This ground-breaking study throws new light upon the shaping of our ideas about the mind, and provides a historical context for burgeoning contemporary investigations of the emotions.",Philosophy,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=dwdREAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

57E7DgAAQBAJ,Socrates and Other Saints,Dariusz Karlowicz,"Many contemporary writers misunderstand early Christian views on philosophy because they identify the critical stances of the ante-Nicene fathers toward specific pagan philosophical schools with a general negative stance toward reason itself. Dariusz Karłowicz's Socrates and Other Saints demonstrates why this identification is false. The question of the extent of humanity's natural knowledge cannot be reduced to the question of faith's relationship to the historical manifestations of philosophy among the Ancients. Karłowicz closely reads the writings of Justin Martyr, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, and others to demonstrate this point. He also builds upon Pierre Hadot's thesis that ancient philosophy is not primarily theory but a ""way of life"" taught by sages, which aimed at happiness through participation in the divine. The fact that pagan philosophers falsely described humanity's telos did not mean that the spiritual practices they developed could not be helpful in the Christian pilgrimage. As it turns out, the ancient Christian writers traditionally considered to be enemies of philosophy actually borrowed from her much more than we think--and perhaps more than they admitted.",Religion,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=57E7DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

They are the big questions—about happiness and the good life, the limits of knowledge, the ultimate structure of reality, the nature of consciousness, the relation between causality and free will, the pervasiveness of suffering, and the conditions for a just and flourishing society—that thinkers in different cultures across the ages have formulated in their own terms in an attempt to make sense of their lives and the world around them. The essays in this book turn to the major figures and texts of the Buddhist tradition in order to expand and enrich our thinking on these enduring questions. Examining them from a comparative and cross-cultural perspective demonstrates the value of alternative ways of addressing philosophical problems, showing how different approaches can produce new and unexpected kinds of questions and answers. Engaging with the Buddhist tradition, this book shows, helps return philosophy to its practical as well as theoretical aim: not only understanding the world but also knowing how to live in it. Featuring striking and generative comparisons of Buddhist and Western thought, Philosophy’s Big Questions challenges our thinking in fundamental ways and offers readers new conceptual tools, methods, and insights for the pursuit of a good and happy life.",Philosophy,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=2XUDEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

H3YWgvEcoZ0C,Averroes' Physics,Ruth Glasner,"Ruth Glasner presents an illuminating reappraisal of Averroes' physics. Glasner is the first scholar to base her interpretation on the full range of Averroes' writings, including texts that are extant only in Hebrew manuscripts and have not been hitherto studied. She reveals that Averroes changed his interpretation of the basic notions of physics - the structure of corporeal reality and the definition of motion - more than once. After many hesitations he offers a bold new interpretation of physics which Glasner calls 'Aristotelian atomism'. Ideas that are usually ascribed to scholastic scholars, and others that were traced back to Averroes but only in a very general form, are shown not only to have originated with him, but to have been fully developed by him into a comprehensive and systematic physical system. Unlike earlier Greek or Muslim atomistic systems, Averroes' Aristotelian atomism endeavours to be fully scientific, by Aristotelian standards, and still to provide a basis for an indeterministic natural philosophy. Commonly known as 'the commentator' and usually considered to be a faithful follower of Aristotle, Averroes is revealed in his commentaries on the Physics to be an original and sophisticated philosopher.",Science,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=H3YWgvEcoZ0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

It argues that while there is a metaphysical answer to the question of personal identity, there is no metaphysical answer to the question of what constitutes a person. The author argues against both body-mind dualism and physicalism and also against the idea that there is some metaphysically real category of persons distinct from the category of human beings or human organisms. Instead, the author presents neutral-monist, autopoietic-enactivist kind of metaphysics of the human being, and a relational, and completely human-dependent notion of a person. The tools used in these arguments include conceptual argumentation and empirical case studies. Using both personal experiences and studies of cultures all over the world, the author examines dualism between mind and body. The author discusses real people who seem to live a Cartesian life, as somehow disembodied minds as well as the concept of the person. The author uses the concluding chapters to present their own views arguing that questions about our identity should be separated from questions of our personhood as well as the concept of personhood.

i99ADgAAQBAJ,Zhuangzi and Early Chinese Philosophy,Steve Coutinho,"The Daoist philosopher Zhuangzi (also known as Chuang Tzu), along with Confucius, Lao Tzu, and the Buddha, ranks among the most influential thinkers in the development of East Asian thought. His literary style is humorous and entertaining, yet the philosophical content is extraordinarily subtle and profound. This book introduces key topics in early Daoist philosophy. Drawing on several issues and methods in Western philosophy, from analytical philosophy to semiotics and hermeneutics, the author throws new light on the ancient Zhuangzi text. Engaging Daoism and contemporary Western philosophical logic, and drawing on new developments in our understanding of early Chinese culture, Coutinho challenges the interpretation of Zhuangzi as either a skeptic or a relativist, and instead seeks to explore his philosophy as emphasizing the ineradicable vagueness of language, thought and reality. This new interpretation of the Zhuangzi offers an important development in the understanding of Daoist philosophy, describing a world in flux in which things themselves are vague and inconsistent, and tries to show us a Way (a Dao) to negotiate through the shadows of a ""chaotic"" world.",Religion,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=i99ADgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

XL93AAAAMAAJ,Empowering Philosophy and Science with the Art of Love,John Raymaker,"Philosophy and Science are subject to conflicting interpretations, such as the rules of positivism and analytic thought. Bernard Lonergan and Gilles Deleuze have both assessed such issues in complementary fashion. This book examines their arguments through the application of mathematical theories and Buddhist-Christian ethics. Using a structured analogy based on a spiritual genome, Empowering Philosophy and Science with the Art of Love seeks to bridge the religious-secularist divide exacerbated by postmodernism. The goal is to empower the practitioners of philosophy and science by having them pay heed to the art of ethical virtue.",Philosophy,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=XL93AAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
